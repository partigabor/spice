# Welcome to the *Spices & Spice Terminology Database* 1.0 (Beta)

This website contains information on spices and spice names. It aims to list, categorize, and introduce spices from a [philological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) point of view, focusing on their origins, history, spread, cultural significance, and linguistic analysis. The website is based on a Ph.D. dissertation currently under review and revision, titled *Mapping the Language of Spices: A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain*.

>The database is currently in a developmental state, I plan an initial release in 2023, after the thesis has been defended, and a revised version has been published.

The goal of this project is to gather the available knowledge on spices (and in the future herbs, incense, and other aromatics as well), especially in terms of historical data. Our hypothesis is that along their journey during early global trade, these materials have left a continuous trail, which serves as linguistic evidence.
