# Welcome to the *Spices & Spice Terminology Database* 1.0 (beta)

This website contains information on spices and spice names. It aims to list, categorize, and introduce spices from a [philological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) point of view, focusing on their origins, history, spread, cultural significance, and linguistic analysis. The website is based on a Ph.D. dissertation currently under review and revision, titled *Mapping the Language of Spices: A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain*.
