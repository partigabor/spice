# How to Cite

As the Ph.D. dissertation is still under review and revision, and related papers are still in manuscript form, please only cite the website if you really must. However, as the website is currently still under development, I urge you to update your citation after the planned release in mid-2023.

To cite a website with no date according to APA 7th style:

#### Format

>Last name, Initials. (n.d.). *Page title*. Site Name. Retrieved Month Day, Year, from URL

#### Example of this page

>Parti, G. (n.d.). *How to Cite*. Spices and Spice Terminology Database. Retrieved December 12, 2022, https://partigabor.github.io/spice/book/cite/
