⚓ Website Under Development ⚓

Welcome!

This website contains information on spices and spice names. It is based on a Ph.D. dissertation currently under review and revision, titled *Mapping the Language of Spices: A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain*. 

Currently this database is still in its developmental state, I plan an initial release in 2023, after the thesis has been defended, and a revised version has been published.
