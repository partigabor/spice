  {"id":"abiderexiti_construction_2019","abstract":"Automatically building semantic resources is essential to low resource-languages like Uyghur. However, Uyghur suffers from a lack of publicly available evaluation dataset for automatically building semantic resources like WordNet. To cope with this problem, first, we build the largest Uyghur-English and English-Uyghur dictionaries by exploiting many possible online and offline resources. Then by using Princeton WordNet (PWN)3.0 and Contemporary Uyghur Detailed Dictionary (CUDD), we construct an English-Uyghur WordNet evaluation dataset which is publicly available (https://github.com/kaharjan/uywordnet). In this dataset, more than 73,000 English synsets are mapped Uyghur automatically, in which over 20,000 are annotated manually. And the corresponding Uyghur words include definition and examples in Uyghur language context. We also propose a Synset Mapping based on Word Embeddings(SMWE) method. The experimental results on the dataset are promising.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Abiderexiti","given":"Kahaerjiang"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Maosong"}],"citation-key":"abiderexiti_construction_2019","container-title":"Chinese Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-32381-3_31","editor":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Maosong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuanjing"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-32380-6 978-3-030-32381-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"382-393","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Construction of an English-Uyghur WordNet Dataset","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-32381-3_31","volume":"11856"},

MusicLM casts the process of conditional music generation as a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence modeling task, and it generates music at 24 kHz that remains consistent over several minutes. Our experiments show that MusicLM outperforms previous systems both in audio quality and adherence to the text description. Moreover, we demonstrate that MusicLM can be conditioned on both text and a melody in that it can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption. To support future research, we publicly release MusicCaps, a dataset composed of 5.5k music-text pairs, with rich text descriptions provided by human experts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Agostinelli","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Denk","given":"Timo I."},{"family":"Borsos","given":"Zalán"},{"family":"Engel","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Verzetti","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Caillon","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Aren"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Tagliasacchi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Sharifi","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Zeghidour","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"agostinelli_musiclm_2023","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,26]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2301.11325","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"MusicLM: Generating Music From Text","title-short":"MusicLM","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11325"},

Importance of Qarābādhīn gradually increased and acquired an imperative status. The history of Qarābādhīn starts from Chiron, Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen in Greco-Roman era. Many of early and medieval Islamic and Arab physicians play vital role and immense original contribution in this discipline and authored important and essential Qarābādhīn with systemic and scientific approaches. Although some of them could not reach the present day, many of the manuscripts can be found in various libraries across the world. Since the Arab Caliphates appreciated and patronized the fields of medicine acquired from Greeks and worked for its development, this period also known as “Greco-Arabic era”. In this work the evaluation of Qarābādhīn (particularly written in Arabic or Greek language) was done in historical and regulatory perspective particularly in Greek era and later on in Medieval Islamic era. The findings of the review indicate the importance and regulatory status of Qarābādhīn and provide information about it. It can be helpful to explore Qarābādhīn and related publications of Greek and Medieval Islamic Arabic period, which gives foundations for the present-day pharmacopeias.

  {"id":"allen_devil_2002","abstract":"Deliciously organized by the Seven Deadly Sins, here is a scintillating history of forbidden foods through the ages--and how these mouth-watering taboos have defined cultures around the world. From the lusciously tempting fruit in the Garden of Eden to the divine foie gras, Stewart Lee Allen engagingly illustrates that when a pleasure as primal as eating is criminalized, there is often an astonishing tale to tell. Among the foods thought to encourage Lust, the love apple (now known as the tomato) was thought to possess demonic spirits until the nineteenth century. The Gluttony \"course\" invites the reader to an ancient Roman dinner party where nearly every dish served--from poppy-crusted rodents to \"Trojan Pork\"--Was considered a crime against the state. While the vice known as Sloth introduces the sad story of \"The Lazy Root\" (the potato), whose popularity in Ireland led British moralists to claim that the Great Famine was God's way of punishing the Irish for eating a food that bred degeneracy and idleness. Filled with incredible food history and the author's travels to many of these exotic locales, In the Devil's Garden also features recipes like the matzo-ball stews outlawed by the Spanish Inquisition and the forbidden \"chocolate champagnes\" of the Aztecs. This is truly a delectable book that will be consumed by food lovers, culinary historians, amateur anthropologists, and armchair travelers alike. Bon app?tit!

You can use peppermint to settle an upset stomach, ease arthritis pain with stinging nettles, and heal burns and wounds with aloe vera. And then there is cannabis, perhaps the most notorious herb of all. Despite the fact that herbs are often little more than weeds, cultures around the globe have found hundreds of uses for them, employing them in everything from ancient medicines to savoury dishes. While much has been written on cooking and healing with herbs, little has been told about the history of the plants themselves and the incredible journeys they have made. These often overlooked plants have become a staple in our lives. Unlike spices that quickly traversed the globe through trade, herbs were often hoarded by their cultivators and were central to distinctive regional dishes. This book examines herbs in new ways, making it essential reading for any serious foodie.

While a group of heterosexual males were reviving Turner’s account of the US frontier experience in the mid–twentieth century, Child—along with a cohort of female collaborators and several gay men writing back home in the states—were positing a non-isolationist vision of America and a more cosmopolitan imaginary of its relations with other countries.

  {"id":"alrabiah_design_2013","abstract":"In this paper, we report the design and construction of King Saud University Corpus of Classical Arabic (KSUCCA), which is part of ongoing research that attempts to study the meanings of words used in the holy Quran, through analysis of their distributional semantics in contemporaneous texts. The holy Quranic text was revealed in pure Classical Arabic, which forms the basis of Arabic linguistic theory and which is well understood by the educated Arabic reader. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the distributional lexical semantics of the Quran's words in the light of similar texts (corpus) that are written in pure Classical Arabic. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two corpora of Classical Arabic one is part of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Arabic Corpus (KACST Arabic Corpus) and the other is the Classical Arabic Corpus (CAC) (Elewa, 2009). However, neither of the two corpora is adequate for our research the former does not cover many genres such as: Linguistics, Literature, Science, Sociology and Biography and it only contains 17+ million words, so it is not very large. While the latter is even smaller with only 5 million words. Therefore, we made an effort to carefully design and compose our own corpus bearing in mind that it should be large enough, balanced, and representative so that any result obtained from it can be generalized for Classical Arabic. In addition, we tried to make the design general enough in order to make the corpus also appropriate for other research.","author":[{"family":"Alrabiah","given":"M."},{"family":"Al-Salman","given":"A."},{"family":"Atwell","given":"E.

Yet these same officials gave official titles to Chinese pirates as part of a \"summon and appease\" (zhaofu) policy in the hope that the pirates would abandon crime for more civilized pursuits. After a decade of frustrations, the Dutch decided to take a page from the pirates' playbook and tried to unite the pirates to attack China. The pirate war against China did not go well for the Dutch, who failed to unite the pirates under their leadership. Nonetheless, they did eventually reach a modus vivendi with Chinese officials and began trading regularly with China. Yet after the collapse of the Ming Empire in 1644, the Dutch increasingly suffered competition from an ex-pirate organization: the powerful Zheng family. Its leader, Zheng Chenggong, created a loyalist state with maritime pretensions. So long as the company was competing against private Chinese seamen who lacked state support, it was able to hold its own. But once these seamen were united in the framework of a maritime Chinese state, the company could not prevail.]","author":[{"family":"Andrade","given":"Tonio"}],"citation-key":"andrade_company_2004","container-title":"Journal of World History","ISSN":"10456007, 15278050","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"415-444","publisher":"University of Hawai'i Press","title":"The Company's Chinese Pirates: How the Dutch East India Company Tried to Lead a Coalition of Pirates to War against China, 1621-1662","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20079290","volume":"15"},

Recently, an increasing body of research in perception language and in Food Studies has been sparkling new interest and new perspectives on the importance of this sense. Merging anthropology, evolutionary physiology and philosophy, this book investigates the language of Taste in English, and its relationship with our embodied minds. In the first part of the book, the author explores the semantic dimensions of Taste terms with a usage-based approach. With the application of experimental protocols, Bagli enquires their possible organization in a radial network and calculates the Salience index of gustatory terms in both American and British English. The second part of the book is an overview of the metaphorical extensions that motivate the polysemy of Taste terms, with the aid of corpus analysis methods and various texts. This book is the first to review systematically and in a usage-based perspective the role of the sensory domain of Taste in English, showing a more complicated picture and suggesting that its under-representation and difficulty of encoding does not correspond to lack of importance.","author":[{"family":"Bagli","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"bagli_tastes_2021","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-11-062677-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"De Gruyter Mouton","publisher-place":"Berlin","title":"Tastes We Live by: The Linguistic Conceptualisation of Taste in English","type":"book"},

The book first summarizes some of the problems of grammatical description encountered from Saussure through the present and then outlines possibilities for new descriptions of language which take into account sociolinguistic factors. For instance, a static framework would view creole situations as \"freak\" situations and creoles as necessarily unstable and rapidly changing. A dynamic framework would endorse the Saussurian paradox that competence is looked for exclusively in the individual, but variety is sought in society. A dynamic framework would hold that competence is polylectal what language-users know about communicating with others more nearly represents their language competence than the subset of this knowledge exhibited in production. The bulk of the text centers around the enumeration of principles and the presentation of models for variation theory. A paper on feature marking and weighting is appended.

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution.

Too often, accomplishment does not equal success. We did the work but didn't get the promotion; we played hard but weren't recognized; we had the idea but didn't get the credit. We convince ourselves that talent combined with a strong work ethic is the key to getting ahead, but also realize that combination often fails to yield results, without any deeper understanding as to why. Recognizing this striking disconnect, the author, along with a team of renowned researchers and some of the most advanced data-crunching systems on the planet, dedicated themselves to one goal: uncovering that ever-elusive link between performance and success. Now, based on years of academic research, The Formula finally unveils the groundbreaking discoveries of their pioneering study, not only highlighting the scientific and mathematic principles that underpin success, but also revolutionizing our understanding of: -Why performance is necessary but not adequate -Why \"Experts\" are often wrong -How to assemble a creative team primed for success -How to most effectively engage our networks -And much more","author":[{"family":"Barabási","given":"Albert-László"}],"citation-key":"barabasi_formula_2018","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-316-50546-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1059417906","publisher":"Little Brown & Company","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The formula: the universal laws of success","title-short":"The formula","type":"book"},

Taste is mediated by the chorda tympani (anterior) and the glossopharyngeal (posterior) nerves. Unilateral anesthesia of the chorda tympani intensified some taste sensations from the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal. For some subjects, even with no stimulation, a phantom taste sensation appeared in the area innervated by the contralateral glossopharyngeal nerve. Thus when one taste nerve is damaged another compensates; however, the cost may be a taste phantom. Work on genetic variation in taste has identified supertasters of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) who are unusually sensitive to bitters and sweets as well as the burn from chili pepper (active ingredient capsaicin). Supertasters appear to have more tastebuds and since tastebuds have trigeminal neurons (mediating pain) associated with them, there is an association between perception of taste and irritation.","author":[{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."}],"citation-key":"bartoshuk_biological_1993","container-title":"Food Quality and Preference","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0950-3293(93)90310-3","ISSN":"0950-3293","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"21-32","title":"The Biological Basis of Food Perception and Acceptance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0950329393903103","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"bartoshuk_taste_2012","abstract":"Otitis media and tonsillectomy are associated with enhanced palatability of energy dense foods and with weight gain. Otitis media can damage the chorda tympani nerve (CN VII); tonsillectomy and head and neck radiation treatment can damage the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Both of these nerves function prominently in taste sensation. The present study utilizes these sources of damage to study central interactions among the nerves that mediate oral sensations. Mild damage restricted to one of these nerves can actually intensify sensations evoked from undamaged nerves (i.e., whole‐mouth taste, oral tactile sensations evoked by fats and irritants). These intensifications may result from disruption of central inhibitory taste circuits, as taste damage appears to disinhibit other oral sensory nerves. In addition, mild damage restricted to one taste nerve can intensify odors perceived from foods in the mouth during chewing and swallowing (i.e., retronasal olfaction); this may be a secondary consequence of the intensification of whole-mouth taste. Damage to both nerves leads to widespread oral sensory loss. At present, the link between sensory alterations and weight gain has not been established for adults (e.g., does increased fat preference occur in individuals with oral sensory intensifications, those with losses, or both?). Finally, pain in non-oral locations is also related to taste loss. When participants rated “the most intense pain of any kind they had ever experienced,” those with the greatest taste loss gave the highest ratings. These effects suggest that taste loss significantly influences long-term health outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Catalanotto","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Logan","given":"Henrietta"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Derek J."}],"citation-key":"bartoshuk_taste_2012","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.06.013","ISSN":"0031-9384","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"516-526","title":"Taste Damage (Otitis Media, Tonsillectomy and Head and Neck Cancer), Oral Sensations and BMI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938412002375","volume":"107"},

Along the way, readers will learn, among other things, about Roquefort cheese's fabled origins, the scientific drive to brew better beer, and the then-controversial biological theory that saved French wine.

Since the publication of the last etymological dictionary of Greek, both the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, and our knowledge of the Greek substrate have led to numerous, often surprising new insights into the history and formation of the Greek vocabulary. This dictionary is a treasure trove covering 2000 years of Ancient Greek: from Mycenaean via Homer and the classical period to lexicographers, such as Hesychius (5th century A.D.). It at last brings together all new data, resulting in scores of thoroughly revised etymologies.

  {"id":"bentley_oxford_2012","abstract":"The Oxford Handbook of World History\n              presents thirty-one articles by leading historians on the most important issues explored by contemporary world historians. These broadly fall into four categories: conceptions of the global past, themes in world history, processes of world history, and regions in world history. The articles on conceptions deal with issues of space and time as treated in the field of world history as well as questions of method, epistemology, the historiography of the area, and globalization as viewed from historical perspective. Themes present in the book include the natural environment, agriculture, pastoral nomadism, science, technology, state formation, gender, and religion. Articles dealing with large-scale processes review current thinking on some of the most influential developments of the global past, including mass migrations, cross-cultural trade, biological diffusions, imperial expansion, industrialization, and cultural and religious exchanges. And finally, a set of articles explores the distinctive historical development within the world's major regions, while also situating individual regions in the larger global context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]]},"citation-key":"bentley_oxford_2012","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001","editor":[{"family":"Bentley","given":"Jerry H."}],"event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-923581-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"The Oxford Handbook of World History","type":"book","URL":"http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199235810"},
  {"id":"bentley_picturing_2019","abstract":"Combining strikingly new scholarship by art historians, historians, and ethnomusicologists, this interdisciplinary volume illuminates trade ties within East Asia, and from East Asia outwards, in the years 1550 to 1800. While not encyclopedic, the selected topics greatly advance our sense of this trade picture. Throughout the book, multi-part trade structures are excavated; the presence of European powers within the Asian trade nexus features as part of this narrative. Visual goods are highlighted, including lacquerwares, musical instruments, Chinese bronze coins, unfired ceramic portrait figurines, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian ceramic vessels. These essays underscore the significance of Asian industries producing multiples, and the rhetorical charge of these goods, shifting in meaning as they move. Building reverberations between merchant networks and the look of the objects themselves, this richly-illustrated book brings to light the Asian trade engine powering the early modern visual cultures of East and Southeast Asia, the American colonies, and Europe.","citation-key":"bentley_picturing_2019","collection-title":"Visual and Material Culture, 1300-1700","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvcwn6kn","editor":[{"family":"Bentley","given":"Tamara H."}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-94-6298-467-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Picturing Commerce in and from the East Asian Maritime Circuits, 1550-1800","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvcwn6kn"},

In Eating the Empire, Troy Bickham unfolds the extraordinary role that food played in shaping Britain during the `long' eighteenth century (c. 1660-1837), when coffee, tea, and sugar went from rare luxuries to some of the most ubiquitous commodities in Britain, reaching even the poorest and remotest of households. Bickham reveals how the trade in the empire's edibles underpinned the emerging consumer economy, fomenting the rise of modern retailing, visual advertising and consumer credit, and, via taxes, financed the military and civil bureaucracy that secured, governed and spread the empire.","author":[{"family":"Bickham","given":"Troy O."}],"citation-key":"bickham_eating_2020","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78914-207-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"Eating the Empire: Food and Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain","type":"book"},

On the strength of the new data which has emerged in the last two decades in the form of archaeological findings, as well as new techniques such as GIS modeling, the authors collectively demonstrate the existence of a very early global maritime trade. From architecture to cuisine, and language to clothing, evidence points to early connections both within Asia and between Asia and other continents—well before European explorations of the Global South. The human stories presented here offer insights into both the extent and limits of this global exchange, showing how goods and people traveled vast distances, how they were embedded in regional networks, and how local cultures were shaped as a result.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,22]]},"citation-key":"bille_maritime_2022","DOI":"10.5117/9789463722247","editor":[{"family":"Billé","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Mehendale","given":"Sanjyot"},{"family":"Lankton","given":"James W."}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-5242-9 978-94-6372-224-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Maritime Silk Road: Global Connectivities, Regional Nodes, Localities","title-short":"The Maritime Silk Road","type":"book","URL":"https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463722247"},
  {"id":"billing_antimicrobial_1998","abstract":"Although spices have been important for centuries in food preparation throughout the world, patterns of spice use differ considerably among cultures and countries. What factors underlie these differences? Why are spices used at all? to investigate these questions, we quantified the frequency of use of 43 spices in the meat-based cuisines of the 36 countries for which we could locate traditional cookbooks. A total 4578 recipes from 93 cookbooks was analysed. We also compiled information on the temperature and precipitation in each country, the ranges of spice plants, and the antibacterial properties of each spice. These data were used to investigate the hypothesis that spices inhibit or kill food-spoilage microorganisms. In support of this is the fact that spice plant secondary compounds are powerful antimicrobial (i.e., antibacterial and antifungal) agents. As mean annual temperatures (an indicator of relative spoilage rates of unrefrigerated foods) increased, the proportion of recipes containing spices, number of spices per recipe, total number of spices used, and use of the most potent antibacterial spices all increased, both within and among countries. Likewise, the estimated fraction of bacterial species inhibited per recipe in each country was positively correlated with annual temperature. Several alternative hypotheses were considered-that spices provide macronutrients, disguise the taste and smell of spoiled foods, or increase perspiration and thus evaporative cooling; it also is conceivable that spice use provides no benefits. However, none of these four alternatives was well supported by our data. The proximate reason spices are used obviously is to enhance food palatability. But the ultimate reason is most likely that spices help cleanse foods of pathogens and thereby contribute to the health, longevity and reproductive success of people who find their flavors enjoyable.","author":[{"family":"Billing","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Sherman","given":"Paul W."}],"citation-key":"billing_antimicrobial_1998","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","container-title-short":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/420058","ISSN":"00335770, 15397718","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"language":"en","page":"3-49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Antimicrobial Functions of Spices: Why Some Like it Hot","title-short":"Antimicrobial Functions of Spices","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3036683","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"blaszczyk_kebab_2018","abstract":"The history of food or acts of cooking, eating and drinking have gained growing attention in the humanities and social sciences in the last decade, elaborating social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions of food and foodways in a global context of consumption. \"From Kebab to Ćevapčići\" aims at giving disciplinarily inclusive insights into the culinary histories of “Ottoman Europe\" - of the European territories and people(s), including Turkey, shaped by or “coping\" with an Ottoman heritage. The analysis of foodways, the changing practices related to food production, distribution and consumption, the way food and foodways were imagined and described, serve as a means to better understand the historical entanglement of this area into global flows, the local appropriation of new foodstuffs and recipes, the imagination of exclusive possession, and the negotiation or maintenance of difference. The volume assembles 16 essays, most of which were originally delivered as papers at a conference held at Justus-Liebig-University, Gießen/Germany in fall of 2015. Their authors come from various scholarly traditions touching in one way or another the histories of the people(s) who used to live within or at the borders of the Ottoman sultan’s imperial shade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,4]]},"citation-key":"blaszczyk_kebab_2018","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvcm4ftx","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Blaszczyk","given":"Arkadiusz"},{"family":"Rohdewald","given":"Stefan"}],"ISBN":"978-3-447-11107-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"Harrassowitz Verlag","source":"JSTOR","title":"From Kebab to Ćevapčići: Foodways in (Post-)Ottoman Europe","title-short":"From Kebab to Ćevapčići","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvcm4ftx"},

The complexity of social systems makes it difficult to evaluate the different mechanisms empirically. We use the four-way typology of mechanisms proposed by Baxter and colleagues (2009), and define them mathematically in such a way that the effects of different mechanisms in the trajectory of a change can be modeled. The model suggests that the widely observed empirical pattern of an S-curve temporal trajectory of change can be captured only if the mechanisms for propagation include replicator selection, that is, differential weighting of the competing variants in a change, except under highly specialized circumstances that probably do not hold in speech communities in general.]","author":[{"family":"Blythe","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Croft","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"blythe_scurves_2012","container-title":"Language","ISSN":"00978507, 15350665","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"269-304","title":"S-curves and the mechanisms of propagation in language change","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23251832","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"breslin_psychophysical_1993","abstract":"Aluminum potassium sulphate [AIK(SO4)2 12H2O—‘alum’] was tested for its ability to elicit oral astringency independently of its ability to elicit taste. First, the astringency produced by alum (10 g/l; 21.1 mM) on the non-gustatory surfaces between the gum and the upper lip was measured. Subjects reported that alum elicited sensations of astringency when the upper lip was moved laterally against the gum. Second, subjects dipped the tongue into two solutions—alum or a mixture solution that approximated the taste of alum—and attempted to determine which solution was more astringent. A slight tendency was found for subjects to identify the mixture as more astringent than the alum. However, the same subjects reported the alum to be more astringent than the mixture when the same solutions were applied under the upper lip. These two experiments support the hypothesis that tactile stimulation is important for producing astringency, whereas taste stimulation of the anterior tongue is not. Third, after the application of alum, lubricating rinses (water, sucrose, Salivart®, corn oil, and the subjects' own saliva) were compared for their ability to decrease astringency. The lubricants reliably decreased original astringency, but to varying degrees depending upon their lubricating properties. All three experiments suggest that tactile sensations caused by increased friction (decreases,in salivary lubrication) between oral membranes are the primary basis of astringent sensations.","author":[{"family":"Breslin","given":"P.

  {"id":"butt_black_2013","abstract":"For millennia, spices have been an integral part of human diets and commerce. Recently, the widespread recognition of diethealth linkages bolsters their dietary importance. The bioactive components present in them are of considerable signiﬁcance owing to their therapeutic potential against various ailments. They provide physiological beneﬁts or prevent chronic ailment in addition to the fundamental nutrition and often included in the category of functional foods. Black pepper (Piper Nigrum L.) is an important healthy food owing to its antioxidant, antimicrobial potential and gastro-protective modules. Black pepper, with piperine as an active ingredient, holds rich phytochemistry that also includes volatile oil, oleoresins, and alkaloids. More recently, cell-culture studies and animal modeling predicted the role of black pepper against number of maladies. The free-radical scavenging activity of black pepper and its active ingredients might be helpful in chemoprevention and controlling progression of tumor growth. Additionally, the key alkaloid components of Piper Nigrum, that is, piperine assist in cognitive brain functioning, boost nutrient’s absorption and improve gastrointestinal functionality. In this comprehensive treatise, efforts are made to elucidate the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory, gastro-protective, and antidepressant activities of black pepper. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of black pepper with different drugs and nutrients is the limelight of the manuscript. However, the aforementioned health-promoting beneﬁts associated with black pepper are proven in animal modeling. Thus, there is a need to conduct controlled randomized trials in human subjects, cohort studies, and meta-analyses. Such future studies would be helpful in recommending its application in diet-based regimens to prevent various ailments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Butt","given":"Masood Sadiq"},{"family":"Pasha","given":"Imran"},{"family":"Sultan","given":"Muhammad Tauseef"},{"family":"Randhawa","given":"Muhammad Atif"},{"family":"Saeed","given":"Farhan"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Waqas"}],"citation-key":"butt_black_2013","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","container-title-short":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2011.571799","ISSN":"1040-8398, 1549-7852","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"en","page":"875-886","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black Pepper and Health Claims: A Comprehensive Treatise","title-short":"Black Pepper and Health Claims","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2011.571799","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"caicedo_taste_2001","abstract":"Recent studies showing that single taste bud cells express multiple bitter taste receptors have reignited a long-standing controversy over whether single gustatory receptor cells respond selectively or broadly to tastants. We examined calcium responses of rat taste receptor cells in situ to a panel of bitter compounds to determine whether individual cells distinguish between bitter stimuli. Most bitter-responsive taste cells were activated by only one out of five compounds tested. In taste cells that responded to multiple stimuli, there were no significant associations between any two stimuli. Bitter sensation does not appear to occur through the activation of a homogeneous population of broadly tuned bitter-sensitive taste cells. Instead, different bitter stimuli may activate different subpopulations of bitter-sensitive taste cells.","author":[{"family":"Caicedo","given":"A."},{"family":"Roper","given":"S.

The volume proposes models for normal eating behavior and discusses how and why eating deviates from these norms.\" \"Leading investigators in the field present their findings on four factors that influence how our eating patterns develop: physiological factors, including those factors leading to taste aversions developmental factors, starting with the effects of a pregnant woman's food choices on her child's later food preferences biological factors, including genetics and the search for internal cues that prompt eating factors cultural factors, including the powerful influence of family and social norms.\" \"Why We Eat What We Eat explores how these factors interact to shape our individual eating preferences and discusses the implications of this research for practitioners. The volume also compares eating patterns in the nonobese and the obese person and discusses the short-term satiety factor that ensures consumption of a variety of foods.\" \"Why We Eat What We Eat expands on themes in the well-received volume Taste, Experience, and Feeding and makes the information accessible to a wider audience. It will be of value to anyone interested in eating and its psychological aspects: health psychology researchers and practitioners, physicians, pediatricians, nutritionalists, educators, students, and parents.\"–BOOK JACKET.","author":[{"family":"Capaldi","given":"Elizabeth D."}],"citation-key":"capaldi_why_1996","event-place":"Washington D.C.","ISBN":"1-55798-366-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher-place":"Washington D.C.","title":"Why We Eat What We Eat: The Psychology of Eating","type":"book"},

  {"id":"carboni_wonders_2015","abstract":"\"The subject of this book is the so-called London Qazvīnī, an early 14th-century illustrated Arabic copy of al-Qazvīnī's The Wonders of Creation and the Oddities of Existing Things, which was acquired by the British Library in 1983 (Or. 14140). As is commonly the case for copies of this text, the London Qazvīnī is lavishly illustrated, with 368 extant paintings out of the estimated original ca. 520. Its large format, ambitious illustrative cycle and the fine quality of many of the illustrations suggest that the atelier where it was produced must have been well-established and able to attract craftsmen from different parts of the Ilkhanid area. It also suggests that its patron was wealthy and curious about scientific, encyclopedic and 'ajā'ib literature, and keen to experiment with the illustration of new texts like this work, which had been composed by the author only two or three decades earlier. The only centre that was capable of gathering such artistic influences ranging from Anatolia to Mesopotamia appears to have been Mosul. The London Qazvīnī is an important newly surfaced document for the study of early illustrated Arabic copies of this text, representing the second earliest known surviving manuscript, as well as for the study of Ilkhanid painting. In a single and unique manuscript are gathered earlier Mesopotamian painting traditions, North Jaziran-Seljuq elements, Anatolian inspirations, the latest changes brought about after the advent of the Mongols, and a number of illustrations of extraordinary subjects which escape a proper classification.\" -- Publisher's website\n\nOutgrowth of the author's thesis (doctoral--University of London, 1992) under the title: Wonders of creation and the singularities of Ilkhanid painting","author":[{"family":"Carboni","given":"Stefano"}],"call-number":"ND3399.Q23 C37 2015","citation-key":"carboni_wonders_2015","collection-title":"Edinburgh studies in Islamic art","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-0-7486-8324-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn919015993","number-of-pages":"428","publisher":"Edinburgh University Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The wonders of creation and the singularities of painting: a study of the Ilkhanid London Qazvīnī","title-short":"The wonders of creation and the singularities of painting","type":"book"},
  {"id":"cardone_saffron_2020","abstract":"Saﬀron is obtained from the dried red stigmas of Crocus sativus L., an autumnal herbaceous ﬂowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is largely cultivated in Iran, India, Afghanistan, Greece, Morocco, Spain and Italy. Saﬀron global production is estimated at 418 t y−1 on 121,338 ha. It is known as the most expensive spice in the world and as beneﬁcial for human health due to three main bioactive compounds: crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. The demand for saﬀron is increasing worldwide for its interesting role in cuisine, medicine and cosmetics. Due to the reduction of its production, recent investigations have been conducted to study how to improve stigma yield, quality and antioxidant activity by selecting of corm geographical origin and climatic conditions, using biostimulants such as mycorrhizal fungi as well as choosing irrigation regimes, drying methods and storage processes. New research activities have been focused on the medicinal properties of this spice, such as its neuroprotection in the context of ocular disease, free radical scavenging and detoxifying capacities. This work oﬀers an overview of the historical, economic, genetic, botanical, agronomic and qualitative traits of saﬀron as well as the properties, traditional and recent uses of the spice as well as its by-products such as tepals, stamens, styles, corms and leaves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cardone","given":"Loriana"},{"family":"Castronuovo","given":"Donato"},{"family":"Perniola","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Cicco","given":"Nunzia"},{"family":"Candido","given":"Vincenzo"}],"citation-key":"cardone_saffron_2020","container-title":"Scientia Horticulturae","container-title-short":"Scientia Horticulturae","DOI":"10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109560","ISSN":"03044238","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.), The King of Spices: An Overview","title-short":"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.), the king of spices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304423820303885","volume":"272"},

  {"id":"carling_causality_2019","abstract":"All languages borrow words from other languages. Some languages are more prone to borrowing, while others borrow less, and different domains of the vocabulary are unequally susceptible to borrowing. Languages typically borrow words when a new concept is introduced, but languages may also borrow a new word for an already existing concept. Linguists describe two causalities for borrowing: need, i.e., the internal pressure of borrowing a new term for a concept in the language, and prestige, i.e., the external pressure of borrowing a term from a more prestigious language. We investigate lexical loans in a dataset of 104 concepts in 115 Eurasian languages from 7 families occupying a coherent contact area of the Eurasian landmass, of which Indo-European languages from various periods constitute a majority. We use a cognacy-coded dataset, which identifies loan events including a source and a target language. To avoid loans for newly introduced concepts in languages, we use a list of lexical concepts that have been in use at least since the Chalcolithic (4000–3000 BCE). We observe that the rates of borrowing are highly variable among concepts, lexical domains, languages, language families, and time periods. We compare our results to those of a global sample and observe that our rates are generally lower, but that the rates between the samples are significantly correlated. To test the causality of borrowing, we use two different ranks. Firstly, to test need, we use a cultural ranking of concepts by their mobility (of nature items) or their labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (of culture items). Secondly, to test prestige, we use a power ranking of languages by their socio-cultural status. We conclude that the borrowability of concepts increases with increasing mobility (nature), and with increased labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (culture). We also conclude that language prestige is not correlated with borrowability in general (all languages borrow, independently of prestige), but prestige predicts the directionality of borrowing, from a more prestigious language to a less prestigious one. The process is not constant over time, with a larger inequality during the ancient and modern periods, but this result may depend on the status of the data (non-prestigious languages often remain unattested). In conclusion, we observe that need and prestige compete as causes of lexical borrowing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Carling","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Cronhamn","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Farren","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Aliyev","given":"Elnur"},{"family":"Frid","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"carling_causality_2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0223588","editor":[{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Søren"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e0223588","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The causality of borrowing: Lexical loans in Eurasian languages","title-short":"The causality of borrowing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223588","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"chen_global_2019","abstract":"Using newly developed concepts of network theory, this paper tries to advance the theoretical analysis of Zheng He’s seven epic voyages across the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433, and to resolve some long-debated key issues on the subject. It also attempts to reveal how Zheng He helped change Sino-foreign relations in the early fifteenth ­century by developing tribute-trade networks overseas, and thereby i­ nfluenced the history of China, the Indian Ocean region, and globalization in general. An e­ xamination of the primary sources from the network perspective indicates that the development of tribute-trade relations overseas made up the primary purpose, major ­activities and enduring historical legacies of Zheng He’s voyages. Zheng He initiated the construction of overseas bases for navigation and trade, and thus greatly promoted the institutionalization and expansion of tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world. Both the tribute and trade networks contracted ­after Zheng He’s voyages ended because of their failure to diversify beyond state-m­ onopolized diplomacy and trade. But their development in the early fifteenth century and their continuity thereafter brought China and Indian Ocean countries into unprecedented interactions. The dual networks also provided a foundation for the European “geographic discoveries” in the Indian Ocean later on, for the early contact between China and the West and ultimately for the globalization of the modern world. ­Therefore, a network analysis of Zheng He’s voyages and the subsequent tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world can refine the current theoretical paradigms and narrative frameworks of world history, which are still centered on the rise and expansion of modern Europe and the West. It also reveals how such non-Western historical movements and premodern tribute-trade relations exerted influence on a global network revolution, which linked the old and new worlds through an unprecedented level of relational institutionalization, expansion, diversification and interactions between varied network members in global history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhongping"}],"citation-key":"chen_global_2019","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101002","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"3-49","title":"Toward a Global Network Revolution: Zheng He’s Maritime Voyages and Tribute-Trade Relations between China and the Indian Ocean World","title-short":"Toward a Global Network Revolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p3_3.xml","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"chen_mandarin_2019","abstract":"Modality exclusivity norms have been developed in different languages for research on the relationship between perceptual and conceptual systems. This paper sets up the first modality exclusivity norms for Chinese, a Sino-Tibetan language with semantics as its orthographically relevant level. The norms are collected through two studies based on Chinese sensory words. The experimental designs take into consideration the morpho-lexical and orthographic structures of Chinese. Study 1 provides a set of norms for Mandarin Chinese single-morpheme words in mean ratings of the extent to which a word is experienced through the five sense modalities. The degrees of modality exclusivity are also provided. The collected norms are further analyzed to examine how sub-lexical orthographic representations of sense modalities in Chinese characters affect speakers’ interpretation of the sensory words. In particular, we found higher modality exclusivity rating for the sense modality explicitly represented by a semantic radical component, as well as higher auditory dominant modality rating for characters with transparent phonetic symbol components. Study 2 presents the mean ratings and modality exclusivity of coordinate disyllabic compounds involving multiple sense modalities. These studies open new perspectives in the study of modality exclusivity. First, links between modality exclusivity and writing systems have been established which has strengthened previous accounts of the influence of orthography in the processing of visual information in reading. Second, a new set of modality exclusivity norms of compounds is proposed to show the competition of influence on modality exclusivity from different linguistic factors and potentially allow such norms to be linked to studies on synesthesia and semantic transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Hsuan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Long","given":"Yunfei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"chen_mandarin_2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0211336","editor":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Zhiqiang"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e0211336","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mandarin Chinese modality exclusivity norms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211336","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"chen_metaphor_2019","abstract":"Metaphors are compact packages of information with rich cultural background information. As one of the most powerful linguistic forms with non-literal meaning, metaphor detection in natural language processing can be both challenging and rewarding. We propose an innovative method for metaphor detection and classiﬁcation leveraging culturally grounded eventive information. This culturally grounded information is organized based on ontological structure, which in turn facilitates further semantic processing of the result of our classiﬁcation. As a culturally bound ontological system, the Chinese writing system has basic concepts organized according to semantic radicals, which are symbols containing rich eventive information that represent categorical concepts. This paper illustrates the basic design principles of applying ontological structures in metaphor detection by taking into account radicals representing body parts, instruments, materials, and movements. Our approach to leverage the eventive information of the Chinese writing system in metaphor detection is based on the fact that such information is available as an integral part of the writing system of any text. We hypothesize that eventive information can be accessed through the ‘‘embodied’’ source domain information represented by the radicals without syntactic processing or annotation. In terms of the theory of metaphor, we further hypothesize that eventive types in the embodied source domain maps to, and hence can help to predict, eventive meaning in the target domain of metaphor. Our studies show that the event information encoded in lexical items can facilitate classiﬁcation of metaphoric events and identiﬁcation of metaphors in Chinese texts effectively. We achieved improvements in Chinese metaphor detection over state-of-the-art approaches in our ﬁrst classiﬁcation experiment, and our proposed approach is shown to be generalizable in a second experiment involving new sets of characters with the same radicals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Hsuan"},{"family":"Long","given":"Yunfei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"chen_metaphor_2019","container-title":"IEEE Access","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892042","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"10987-10998","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metaphor Detection: Leveraging Culturally Grounded Eventive Information","title-short":"Metaphor Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610071/","volume":"7"},

However, without access to source data it is difﬁcult to account for domain shift, which represents a threat to validity.

We introduce two lightweight techniques for this scenario, and demonstrate that they reliably increase out-ofdomain accuracy on four multi-domain text classiﬁcation datasets when used with linear and contextual embedding models.

In answer to the question of implementation, we propose the concept of LEXICAL DIFFUSION. We have amassed a sizable amount of evidence drawn from the history of Chinese, English, and Swedish, as well as from language acquisition, to substantiate the claim that a phonological change propagates itself gradually across the lexicon, from morpheme to morpheme. In partial answer to the second question, concerning the actuation of phonological processes, we propose that the principal determinants of sound change are to be sought in the inherent constraints of the physiological and perceptual apparatus of the language user. To illustrate the point, we have investigated the attrition of the consonantal endings in a large number of Chinese dialects, and have found significant parallels in the development of well-known Indo-European languages. We argue that the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern and schedule of the related processes are traceable to their PHONETIC ACTUATION.

  {"id":"chen_study_2014","abstract":"Summary Since Japanese language makes extensive use of Chinese characters in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese in ancient times, it makes people to believe that Chinese always has the overwhelming influence on Japanese. However, the situation is completely changed since modern times. A great number of Japanese words entered into Chinese. Nevertheless, many Chinese people still think that nowadays Chinese language is in a dominant position in linguistic exchange between Chinese and Japanese. The goal of this research is to give people better understanding of the significance of Japanese loanwords in modern Chinese. In this paper, I analyze the channels, classifications, characteristics and influences of Japanese loanwords in different time backgrounds. The findings are mainly based on about one thousand Japanese loanwords that I collected from dictionaries and academic papers. The main results are that Japanese loanwords take an important part in creating new words and formating modern Chinese. Research also indicates that both linguistic factor and social factor affect loanwords, meanwhile, the host language and society are influenced by loanwords. Therefore both Chinese language and society affect the intakes of Japanese loanwords, at the same time the Chinese language and society are also influenced by Japanese loanwords.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Haijing"}],"citation-key":"chen_study_2014","event-place":"Oslo","genre":"M.A.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher":"University of Oslo","publisher-place":"Oslo","title":"A Study of Japanese Loanwords in Chinese","type":"thesis"},
  {"id":"chen_systemic_2020","abstract":"Previous studies on loanwords have tended to be langue-based, focusing on lexicographical documentation and on establishing formal criteria for integration of loanwords into the recipient language in terms of experiential meaning. The recent pragmatic turn in loanword studies signals a parole-oriented approach which shifts attention to the use and functions of loanwords in the recipient language beyond denotative meanings alone. However, there has not been a consistent systematic linguistic framework that could characterize loanwords in the recipient language and that could explore the interaction of langue and parole concerning loanwords. This paper intends to fill this gap by proposing a corpus-informed systemic functional linguistic (SFL) model to account for the characterology of loanwords. Based on the proposed multi-stratal model, kowtow, a Chinese loanword into the English language, is examined for its behaviours at the strata of phonology, lexicogrammar, and discourse semantics as well as how it is embedded in context. Attention at these various levels shows that kowtow demonstrates rich lexicogrammatical productivity in the recipient language and displays strikingly different lexicogrammatical patterns from its Chinese counterpart, indicating that its meaning potentials are activated and extended in the cross-cultural contexts. In fact, by crossing cultures, it actually inverts its connotative meaning.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Wenge"},{"family":"Irwin","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Junjun"}],"citation-key":"chen_systemic_2020","container-title":"Lingua","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2020.102977","ISSN":"0024-3841","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"102977","title":"Towards a Systemic Functional Model for Characterizing Chinese Loanwords in English: The Case of Kowtow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384120301856","volume":"248"},

Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women.

This is a response to, and continuation of, Elizabeth Malischewski's 1987 article ‘Loan words to the Middle Kingdom’ in\n              ET\n              12, the author expresses the hope that this description ‘might serve as a useful addition to’ it (Wang 2004:47). We are as delighted to see the topic revisited after sixteen years as the editor, who states that Wang's article is ‘a valued addition to our series on English, China, China English, and Chinglish, and to Malischewski's original piece’ (McArthur 2004:2). However, we found that quite a number of words listed in the article are not loanwords, because of misunderstandings regarding\n              loan word\n              and\n              loan translation\n              in English and\n              wailaici\n              and\n              wailaiyu\n              , equivalents of\n              loanword\n              in a broader sense in Chinese, as a result of which his classification of the borrowings is confusing. The article has also tended to over-simplify the complex situation of such borrowings in Chinese and as such is misleading. We would like in this paper to clarify some of the misunderstandings and offer a brief introduction to the study of English borrowings in Chinese, a field which began c.1913 with the publication of Evan Morgan's\n              Chinese New Terms & Expressions\n              in Shanghai.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chenggang","given":"Zhou"},{"family":"Yajun","given":"Jiang"}],"citation-key":"chenggang_wailaici_2004","container-title":"English Today","container-title-short":"English Today","DOI":"10.1017/S0266078404003086","ISSN":"0266-0784, 1474-0567","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,7]]},"language":"en","page":"45-52","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"<i>Wailaici</i> and English borrowings in Chinese","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0266078404003086/type/journal_article","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"cheung_impossible_2022","abstract":"\"In a place where time is running out, sometimes the most radical act is remembrance. Hong Kong has long been known as a city of extremes: a former colony of the United Kingdom that today exists at the margins of an authoritarian, ascendant China; a city rocked by mass protests, where residents take to the streets to rally against encroaching threats on their democracy and freedoms. But it is also misunderstood and often romanticized, its history and politics oversimplified in Western headlines. Drawing richly from her own experience, as well as countless interviews with the artists, protestors, students, and writers who have made Hong Kong their home, journalist Karen Cheung gives us an insider's view of this remarkable city, making the case along the way that we should look to Hong Kong as a warning sign for what lies ahead for other global democracies. Coming of age in the wake of Hong Kong's reunification with China in 1997, Cheung traverses the multifold identities available to her in childhood and beyond, whether that was at her English-speaking international schools, where her classmates were often the children of diplomats or corporate officers, or within her deeply traditional family. Along the way, Cheung gives a personal account of what it's like to seek out affordable housing and mental healthcare in one of the world's most expensive cities. She also takes us into Hong Kong's vibrant indie music and literary scenes--youth-driven spaces of creative resistance. Inevitably, Cheung brings us with her to the protests, where her understanding of what it means to belong to Hong Kong finally crystallized\"--","author":[{"family":"Cheung","given":"Karen"}],"call-number":"DS796.H753","citation-key":"cheung_impossible_2022","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-593-24145-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The impossible city: A Hong Kong memoir","title-short":"The impossible city","type":"book"},

Chipman examines the contributions of Christopher Columbus and Hernando Cortes in creating the foundations of the Spanish Empire in North America. Chipman has produced a readable and accurate narrative for students and the reading public, although some information presented on Cortes cannot be found elsewhere in print and is therefore of interest to specialists in the history of Spain in America. Exclusive material from Professor France V. Scholes and the author share insights into the multi layered complexities of a man born in 1484 and named at birth Fernando Cortes. As for Columbus, born in Genoa on the Italian peninsula in 1451 and given the name Cristobal de Colon, he is a more transformative man than Cortes in bringing Western Civilization to the major Caribbean islands in the Spanish West Indies and beyond. Historians strive to present a usable past and the post-Columbian world is, of course, the modern world. Columbus's discoveries, those of other mariners who followed to the south in America, and still other eastward to the Asia placed the world on the path of global interdependence-both good and ill-for peoples of the world.

  {"id":"clifford_nation_2022","abstract":"Indomie is Indonesia’s largest instant noodle producer and one of the largest in the world. The company has had massive commercial success in both international and domestic markets. As a brand Indomie is caught in two distinct flows: the global and the national. The company is reliant on global supply and distribution networks, without which it would be unable to produce its instant noodles. Simultaneously, Indomie occupies a cultural position as part of an Indonesian soft “gastronationalism.” Drawing on Webb Keane’s work on affordances, I explore how the national and international flows afford specific uses to Indomie with special reference to the brand’s public presentation. Using this method of analysis, I show how Indomie draws from an idea of “Indonesianness” and how other actors have read Indomie as an unconventional symbol of Indonesian nationhood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Joe"}],"citation-key":"clifford_nation_2022","container-title":"Gastronomica","DOI":"10.1525/gfc.2022.22.1.1","ISSN":"1529-3262, 1533-8622","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Nation and the Noodle: Indomie and Identity in Indonesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article/22/1/1/119745/The-Nation-and-the-NoodleIndomie-and-Identity-in","volume":"22"},

Then we argue that this ambiguity will lead it to intervene in whatever protocol we set up to provide data for the agent about its goal.

  {"id":"cook_typology_2018","abstract":"The question of how best to classify Modern Standard Chinese loanwords is rather a fraught one. Various principles of categorization have been proposed in the literature; however, previous classification systems have generally covered only a relatively small proportion of all loanwords currently in use. Even attempts to provide an exhaustive catalog of lexical borrowing strategies have often been characterized by nontransparent structure, internal inconsistency or even incompleteness. This has hindered meaningful cross-linguistic comparisons of language change in Modern Standard Chinese vis-à-vis other languages. The aim of this paper is to present a new and clearly structured, comprehensive inventory of the different types of lexical borrowing that have occurred in Modern Standard Chinese over the past 30 to 40 years. Systematic cross-linguistic comparisons reveal that examples of almost all of the categories of lexical borrowing noted in the literature on English language change can likewise be provided in relation to Modern Standard Chinese. In addition, Chinese offers several options for borrowing lexical items not available to speakers of English. Overall, this paper presents a picture of Modern Standard Chinese speakers as cultivating a flexible, creative, playful approach to their use of language. The explicit recognition of the fact that many so-called “alphabetic words” are established loanwords is found to have implications for the typological classification of Chinese script, as well as for other fields such as second language teaching. A secondary finding not anticipated in the research question is that Chinese orthography shows tentative early signs of potentially developing from a morpho-logographic to a phonetic writing system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Angela"}],"citation-key":"cook_typology_2018","container-title":"Lingua Sinica","container-title-short":"lingua. sin.","DOI":"10.1186/s40655-018-0038-7","ISSN":"2197-6678","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A typology of lexical borrowing in Modern Standard Chinese","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1186/s40655-018-0038-7","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"counts_regum_1996","abstract":"Although embalming is traditionally considered an Egyptian custom, ancient sources suggest that in imperial Rome the practice was not employed by Egyptians or Egyptianized Romans alone. The mos Romanorum in funerary ritual encompassed both cremation and inhumation, yet embalming appears in Rome as early as the first century AD and evidence points to its limited use during the first three centuries AD. Within the social structure of Rome's dead these preserved corpses certainly occupied a distinct place. Yet who were they and why were they embalmed? It is argued here that various factors allowed for the occasional use of embalming by Romans: (1) an apparent shift in attitudes towards Egypt, (2) the manipulation of death ritual for social distinction, and (3) the flexibility of the traditional Roman funeral, which was able to incorporate deviations in methods of body disposal. Although embalming has been largely ignored as a significant aspect of Roman funerary history, its patrons come from the classes of highest status, including even the imperial household. This fact alone makes it worthwhile to examine this small corpus of evidence. For example, the emperor Nero embalmed his wife Poppaea; such a deviation from standard disposal methods reflects imperial fashion, but also requires us to re-evaluate Nero's reign and, especially, the societal constructs of Neronian Rome. This study attempts to contextualize embalming within Roman society and offer some likely causes and effects of its use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Counts","given":"Derek B."}],"citation-key":"counts_regum_1996","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/25011039","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"189-202","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regum Externorum Consuetudine: The Nature and Function of Embalming in Rome","title-short":"Regum Externorum Consuetudine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/ca/article/15/2/189/25301/Regum-Externorum-Consuetudine-The-Nature-and","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"creed_wine_2015","abstract":"In the contemporary era, style is recognised as a significant feature of everyday language communication. Stylistic choices communicate meaning, attitude and emotion to an audience. This is no less true of the creative language used to taste and talk about wine. Wine discourse is rich in metaphorical expressions. As a stylistic device, metaphoric language frames meaning construction to evoke and construe images and emotions, and to elicit sensory perceptions and sensations of an aesthetic product. The language domain of wine is organised by an institutional framework—the genre of wine reviews—encompassing short, persuasive texts used by wine critics to convey their appraisal and appreciation of wine. In this paper I will consider the relationship between text structures, functions, and processes of metaphor in the genre of wine reviews given that meaning is situated in larger contexts of understanding. I present initial findings from a doctoral research project, using a cognitive linguistic theoretical and methodological framework of analysis, which examines the heuristic potential of Australian wine reviews across the cultural and linguistic borders of Australia and China. The paper concludes by highlighting the challenge of intercultural communication for wine education and business development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Creed","given":"Allison"}],"citation-key":"creed_wine_2015","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.1.2700.6886","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Unpublished","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Wine and metaphor: Stylistic choices within an institutional framework","title-short":"Wine and metaphor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.2700.6886"},

  {"id":"croijmans_uncovering_2020","abstract":"Talking about odors and flavors is difficult for most people, yet experts appear to be able to convey critical information about wines in their reviews. This seems to be a contradiction, and wine expert descriptions are frequently received with criticism. Here, we propose a method for probing the language of wine reviews, and thus offer a means to enhance current vocabularies, and as a by-product question the general assumption that wine reviews are gibberish. By means of two different quantitative analyses—support vector machines for classification and Termhood analysis—on a corpus of online wine reviews, we tested whether wine reviews are written in a consistent manner, and thus may be considered informative; and whether reviews feature domain-specific language. First, a classification paradigm was trained on wine reviews from one set of authors for which the color, grape variety, and origin of a wine were known, and subsequently tested on data from a new author. This analysis revealed that, regardless of individual differences in vocabulary preferences, color and grape variety were predicted with high accuracy. Second, using Termhood as a measure of how words are used in wine reviews in a domain-specific manner compared to other genres in English, a list of 146 wine-specific terms was uncovered. These words were compared to existing lists of wine vocabulary that are currently used to train experts. Some overlap was observed, but there were also gaps revealed in the extant lists, suggesting these lists could be improved by our automatic analysis.","author":[{"family":"Croijmans","given":"Ilja"},{"family":"Hendrickx","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Lefever","given":"Els"},{"family":"Majid","given":"Asifa"},{"family":"Van Den Bosch","given":"Antal"}],"citation-key":"croijmans_uncovering_2020","container-title":"Natural Language Engineering","DOI":"10.1017/S1351324919000500","ISSN":"1351-3249","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"511-530","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Uncovering the Language of Wine Experts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/uncovering-the-language-of-wine-experts/9BF0A599B49230297FD6DBA01F07C0DD","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"crowther_ancient_2016","abstract":"Significance\n            The prehistoric settlement of Madagascar by people from distant Southeast Asia has long captured both scholarly and public imagination, but on the ground evidence for this colonization has eluded archaeologists for decades. Our study provides the first, to our knowledge, archaeological evidence for an early Southeast Asian presence in Madagascar and reveals that this settlement extended to the Comoros. Our findings point to a complex Malagasy settlement history and open new research avenues for linguists, geneticists, and archaeologists to further study the timing and process of this population movement. They also provide insight into early processes of Indian Ocean biological exchange and in particular, Madagascar’s floral introductions, which account for one-tenth of its current vascular plant species diversity.\n          , \n            The Austronesian settlement of the remote island of Madagascar remains one of the great puzzles of Indo-Pacific prehistory. Although linguistic, ethnographic, and genetic evidence points clearly to a colonization of Madagascar by Austronesian language-speaking people from Island Southeast Asia, decades of archaeological research have failed to locate evidence for a Southeast Asian signature in the island’s early material record. Here, we present new archaeobotanical data that show that Southeast Asian settlers brought Asian crops with them when they settled in Africa. These crops provide the first, to our knowledge, reliable archaeological window into the Southeast Asian colonization of Madagascar. They additionally suggest that initial Southeast Asian settlement in Africa was not limited to Madagascar, but also extended to the Comoros. Archaeobotanical data may support a model of indirect Austronesian colonization of Madagascar from the Comoros and/or elsewhere in eastern Africa.","author":[{"family":"Crowther","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Leilani"},{"family":"Helm","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Shipton","given":"Ceri"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Henry T."},{"family":"Walshaw","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Pawlowicz","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Radimilahy","given":"Chantal"},{"family":"Douka","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Picornell-Gelabert","given":"Llorenç"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Dorian Q."},{"family":"Boivin","given":"Nicole L."}],"citation-key":"crowther_ancient_2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"dafni_medicinal_2019","abstract":"Background: Previous lists number from 55 to 176 plant species as “Biblical Medicinal Plants.” Modern studies attest that many names on these lists are no longer valid. This situation arose due to old mistranslations and/or mistakes in botanical identification. Many previously recognized Biblical plants are in no way related to the flora of the Bible lands. Accordingly, the list needs revision.\nMethods: We re-examine the list of possible medicinal plants in the Bible based on new studies in Hebrew Biblical philology and etymology, new studies on the Egyptian and Mesopotamian medicinal use of plants, on ethnobotany and on archaeobotany.\nResults: In our survey, we suggest reducing this list to 45 plant species. Our contribution comprises 20 “newly” suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants. Only five species are mentioned directly as medicinal plants in the Bible: Fig (Ficus carica), Nard (Nardostachys jatamansi), Hyssop (Origanum syriacum), balm of Gilead (Commiphora gileadensis) and Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum). No fewer than 18 medicinal plants are mentioned in old Jewish postBiblical sources, in addition to those in the Bible. Most of these plants (15) are known also in Egypt and Mesopotamia while three are from Egypt only. Seven of our suggested species are not mentioned in the Bible or in the Jewish postBiblical literature but were recorded as medicinal plants from Egypt, as well as from Mesopotamia. It is quite logical to assume that they can be included as Biblical Medicinal Plants.\nConclusions: All our suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants are known as such in Ancient Egypt and/or Mesopotamia also. Examination of our list shows that all these plants have been in continuous medicinal use in the Middle East down the generations, as well as being used in the Holy Land today. Precisely in King Solomon’s words, “That which has been is what will be, that which is done is what will be done.

  {"id":"dakin_cacao_2000","abstract":"The origin of the words ‘cacao’ and ‘chocolate’ and their use in the reconstruction of the early history of Mesoamerica, remain very controversial issues. Cambell and Kaufman (1976, American Antiquity 41:80–89), for example, proposed that the word ‘cacao’ originated from Mixe–Zoque languages, thus possibly representing Olmec traditions. According to this argument, other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, borrowed the word as a symbol of prestige and Olmec influence. Other researchers claim the word ‘chocolate’ represents a more recent neologism, a possible Maya–Nahuatl hybrid, due to the late appearance of the word in central Mexico’s Colonial sources. We refute the putative Mixe–Zoque origin of ‘cacao’ and provide linguistic evidence to propose that ‘cacao,’ like ‘chocolate,’ is a Uto-Aztecan term. Analysis of these words highlights general and particular evolutionary trends that originate from the Uto-Aztecan language family. In addition, we show that these two words were initially used as descriptive terms to refer to the shape of the plant’s bean and the techniques of drink preparation. Etymological evidence verifies the use of a Mayan term for cacao as early as the Classic period (fourth century a.d.). This early appearance of the term in Mayan and the later diffusion of the Nahua word throughout all of Mesoamerica correlate with additional data to support the conclusion that Teotihuacanos spoke Nahuatl.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dakin","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Søren"}],"citation-key":"dakin_cacao_2000","container-title":"Ancient Mesoamerica","container-title-short":"Ancient Mesoam","DOI":"10.1017/S0956536100111058","ISSN":"0956-5361, 1469-1787","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,1]]},"language":"en","page":"55-75","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cacao and Chocolate: A Uto-Aztecan Perspective","title-short":"CACAO AND CHOCOLATE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0956536100111058/type/journal_article","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"dalby_language_2003","abstract":"\"Of the approximately 5,000 languages spoken around the globe today, Andrew Dalby predicts that half will be lost during this century. How will this linguistic extinction affect our lives? Is there a possibility that humanity will become a monolingual species? Should we care?\" \"Language in Danger is an historical investigation into the disappearance of languages and the consequences that future generations may face. Whether describing the effects of Latin's displacement of native languages in the aftermath of Rome's imperial expansion or the aggressive extermination of hundreds of indigenous North American languages through a brutal policy of forcing Native Americans to learn English, Dalby reveals that linguistic extinction has traditionally occurred as a result of economic inequality, political oppression, and even genocide. Bringing this historical perspective to bear on the uncertain fate of hundreds of pocket cultures - cultures whose languages are endangered by less obvious threats, such as multinational economic forces, immigration, nationalism, and global telecommunications - Language in Danger speaks out against the progressive silencing of our world's irreplaceable voices.\" \"More than an account of the decline of linguistic diversity, Language in Danger explains why humanity must protect its many unique tongues. Since all languages represent different ways of perceiving, mapping, and classifying the world, they act as repositories for cultural traditions and localized knowledge. The growing trend toward linguistic standarization - for example, politically designated national languages - threatens the existence of more marginalized cultures and ethnic customs, leaving only a few dominant tongues. The resulting languages become less flexible, nuanced, and inventive as they grow increasingly homogenized. Dalby argues that humanity needs linguistic variety not only to communicate, but to sustain and enhance our understanding of the world.\"–BOOK JACKET.","author":[{"family":"Dalby","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"dalby_language_2003","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"0-231-12900-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Language in Danger: The Loss of Linguistic Diversity and the Threat to Our Future","type":"book"},

  {"id":"dale_silk_2009","abstract":"[India and China were the most important producers of textiles in the world prior to the industrial revolution. However, whereas the Western historiography usually discusses Indian cotton and Chinese silk in connection with European imports, or with their sales in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East, cotton and silk were also exchanged between India and China. Indeed, Indian cotton and Chinese silk were probably the principal manufactured goods exchanged between these civilizations. Although Indian records are fragmentary, especially when compared with the voluminous Chinese sources, Indian cotton goods are known to have reached the Indianized states in Xinjiang in the early Common Era (CE), and may have been produced there, in Khotan and the neighbouring states, by the time that indigenous silk production was known to exist in India in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Yet, while in later centuries large amounts of cotton cloth were produced in China while indigenous centres of silk production developed in India, exchanges of the finest types of cotton and silk cloth continued, usually driven by cultural and social factors in each civilization.]","author":[{"family":"Dale","given":"Stephen F."}],"citation-key":"dale_silk_2009","container-title":"Modern Asian Studies","ISSN":"14698099","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"79-88","title":"Silk Road, Cotton Road or....

  {"id":"dalrymple_anarchy_2019","abstract":"In August 1756 the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and forced him to establish in his richest provinces a new administration run by English merchants who collected taxes through means of a ruthless private army--what we would now call an act of involuntary privatization. The East India Company's founding charter authorized it to \"wage war\" and it had always used violence to gain its ends. But the creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional international trading corporation dealing in silks and spices and became something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business. In less than four decades it had trained up a security force of around 200,000 men--twice the size of the British army--and had subdued an entire subcontinent, conquering first Bengal and finally, in 1803, the Mughal capital of Delhi itself. The Company's reach stretched until almost all of India south of the Himalayas was effectively ruled from a boardroom in London. The Anarchy tells the remarkable story of how one of the world's most magnificent empires disintegrated and came to be replaced by a dangerously unregulated private company, based thousands of miles overseas in on small office, five windows wide, and answerable only to its distant shareholders. In his most ambitious and riveting book to date, William Dalrymple tells the story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power. -- Dust jacket flap","author":[{"family":"Dalrymple","given":"William"}],"call-number":"941.073","citation-key":"dalrymple_anarchy_2019","event-place":"London (GB)","ISBN":"978-1-63557-433-3 978-1-4088-6440-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","publisher-place":"London (GB)","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The anarchy: the relentless rise of the East India Company","title-short":"The anarchy","type":"book"},

In spite of its widespread use, the origins of cinnamon was the Arab merchants’ best-kept secret until the early 10th century. To maintain their monopoly on cinnamon trade and justify its exorbitant price, Arab traders' interlaced colorful stories for their buyers about where and how they obtained the luxurious spice.

  {"id":"davies_oxford_2020","abstract":"The unique relationship between word and image in ancient Egypt is a defining feature of that ancient culture's records. All hieroglyphic texts are composed of images, and large-scale figural imagery in temples and tombs is often accompanied by texts. Epigraphy and palaeography are two distinct, but closely related, ways of recording, analyzing, and interpreting texts and images. This Handbook stresses technical issues about recording text and art and interpretive questions about what we do with those records and why we do it. It offers readers three key things: a diachronic perspective, covering all ancient Egyptian scripts from prehistoric Egypt through the Coptic era (fourth millennium BCE-first half of first millennium CE), a look at recording techniques0that considers the past, present, and future, and a focus on the experiences of colleagues. The diachronic perspective illustrates the range of techniques used to record different phases of writing in different media. The consideration of past, present, and future techniques allows readers to understand and assess why epigraphy and palaeography is or was done in a particular manner by linking the aims of a particular effort with the technique chosen to reach those aims. The choice of techniques is a matter of goals and the records' work circumstances, an inevitable consequence of epigraphy being a double projection: geometrical, transcribing in two dimensions an object that exists physically in three; and mental, an interpretation, with an inevitable selection among the object's defining characteristics. The experiences of colleagues provide a range of perspectives and opinions about issues such as techniques of recording, challenges faced in the field, and ways of reading and interpreting text and image.

  {"id":"deignan_metaphorical_1999","abstract":"The recent cognitive view of metaphor has implications for semantic relations between established metaphorical senses of polysemous Iexemes. It has been suggested that the relations of synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy holding between literal senses of lexemes may be replicated by their metaphorical senses. In this paper, lexemes with literal senses in the semantic areas of temperature, illness and tools are examined using concordance data from a large computerized corpus. Semantic relations between their literal and metaphorical senses are studied. It is concluded that semantic relations between literal senses are upheld between their metaphorical counterparts at the most general, abstract level, but that there are a number of inconsistencies when specific uses and collocational patterns are examined. The metaphorical senses of frequent lexemes such as hot or cold are less likely to behave predictably than the metaphorical senses of less frequent lexemes such as chilly or tepid, which often form semantic relationships that echo those of their literal senses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Deignan","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"deignan_metaphorical_1999","container-title":"<i>WORD</i>","container-title-short":"<i>WORD</i>","DOI":"10.1080/00437956.1999.11432491","ISSN":"0043-7956, 2373-5112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,12]]},"language":"en","page":"319-338","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metaphorical polysemy and paradigmatic relations: A corpus study","title-short":"Metaphorical polysemy and paradigmatic relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00437956.1999.11432491","volume":"50"},

The ﬁrst case study involves enriching WordNet with information about human languages and their relationships. The second study shows how machine learning techniques can be used to bootstrap a large-scale multilingual version of WordNet where semantic relationships between terms in many languages are captured.

Drawing on my own archaeological research into early agriculture and arboriculture, I illustrate alternative possibilities for historical interpretation that do not over-emphasize the pre-Lapita isolation of New Guinea, but instead focus on regional interactions and mutual transformations of practice before, during and after the presumed arrival of Austronesian language-speakers in the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Denham","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"denham_roots_2004","container-title":"World Archaeology","container-title-short":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/0043824042000303791","ISSN":"0043-8243, 1470-1375","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,12]]},"language":"en","page":"610-620","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The roots of agriculture and arboriculture in New Guinea: Looking beyond Austronesian expansion, Neolithic packages and indigenous origins","title-short":"The roots of agriculture and arboriculture in New Guinea","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0043824042000303791","volume":"36"},

Its coverage extends from Homer to the early second century A.D. Most of the major authors who fall within that period are included. The Lexicon is based upon principles differing from those of existing Greek lexica. Entries are organised not primarily according to chronological or grammatical criteria, but according to meaning, with a view to showing the developing senses of words and the relationships between those senses. Definitions are given in addition to translations; both are expressed in contemporary English. Other textual and explanatory information is included, such as typical circumstances in which a world may be used, thus giving fresh insights into aspects of Greek language and culture.

  {"id":"dioscorides_fragments_1100","abstract":"The Greek physician Dioscorides lived in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Dioscorides's five-volume treatise Perì üles iatrichès, commonly known in Latin as De materia medica (Of medical substances), is considered the most important medical manual and pharmacopeia of ancient Greece and Rome. It was highly regarded in the Middle Ages in both the Western and Arab worlds. It covers the therapeutic effectiveness of natural substances of animal, vegetable, and mineral origin. The manuscript presented here preserves fragments of an Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work. The work is known in Arabic under various titles, including Kitāb al-ḥashāʼish (The book of plants), Kitāb al-maqālāt al-khams (The five-essay book), or simply, as in this manuscript, Kitāb Disqūrīdis (Dioscorides's book). The first Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work was made by Istafan ibn Basil (Stephanos Basilos) and enhanced by his famed mentor Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-ʻIbadi (circa 809--73), who was tasked by Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to head the historic Bayt al-Hikmah (The House of Wisdom) in Baghdad. This manuscript was most likely copied in Upper Mesopotamia in the 12th century. The work is written in a beautiful naskhi script on parchment. It contains entries from all five books, beginning with plant-based ointments (Book I), and ending with wines and mineral-based potions (Book V). Folio 19 verso gives the name of Hisham ibn Musa ibn Yusuf as the scribe or, possibly, the translator. His title is given as al-masīḥī al-mutaṭabbib, suggesting he was a Christian herbalist. The manuscript is held in the National Library of France, together with two other, similar Arabic manuscripts on Dioscorides. The version preserved here differs from both. A printed text in French at the beginning, which dates from 1909, is a commentary on the colorful illustrations of plants and creatures in the manuscript. It is followed by handwritten notes comparing the differences in Arabic text in each translation, and enumerating the entries of plants and substances included in Dioscorides's work. \nSubject Headings\n    -  Greece \n    -  55 to 90 \n    -  Arabic manuscripts \n    -  Botany \n    -  Medicinal plants \n    -  Medicine, Ancient \n    -  Medicine, Greek and Roman \n    -  Naskh script \n    -  Plants \nNotes\n    -  Title devised, in English, by Library staff. \n    -  Original resource extent: 124 folios : illustrations ; 41 x 32 centimeters. \n    -  Original resource at: National Library of France. \n    -  Content in Arabic and French. \n    -  Description based on data extracted from World Digital Library, which may be extracted from partner institutions.","author":[{"family":"Dioscorides","given":"Pedanius of Anazarbos"}],"citation-key":"dioscorides_fragments_1100","event-place":"NA","issued":{"circa":true,"date-parts":[[1100],[1200]]},"language":"Arabic, French","publisher-place":"NA","source":"https://lccn.loc.gov/2021668182","title":"Fragments of the Treatise on Plants by Dioscorides","translator":[{"literal":"Hisham ibn Musa ibn Yusuf"}],"type":"book","URL":"https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.18415"},

In the course of his exposition Don Ringe draws on a long tradition of work on many languages, including Hittite, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Slavic, Gothic, and Old Norse. This second edition has been significantly revised to provide a more in-depth account of Proto-Indo-European, with further exploration of disputed points; it has also been updated to include new developments in the field, particularly in the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European verb and nominal inflection.

  {"id":"dong_directionality_2021","abstract":"Why are fog, dew, and frost said to ?fall? in some languages when they don?t in the physical world? We explore this seeming infelicity to study the nature of linguistic conceptualization. We focus on variations and changes of the morphosemantic behaviors of weather words in Mandarin and other Sinitic languages with an interdisciplinary approach to establish links between linguistic expressions and scientific facts. We propose that this use of directionality is the result of conventionalization of Chinese people?s inference from shared daily experience, and is well motivated in terms of a linguistic ontology that reflects a scientific account of natural phenomena. We further demonstrate that the semantically relevant orthography shared by Chinese speakers can be directly mapped to Hantology, a formal linguistic ontology based on Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). In this mapping, the radical ? y? ?rain,? derived from the ideograph of ?rain? to represent atmospheric water, provides crucial clues to the use of directional verbs and the parts of speech of weather words. Our findings also lend support to language-based reconstruction of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and lay foundation for TEK research in the Sinosphere.","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Sicong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yike"},{"family":"Ren","given":"He"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"dong_directionality_2021","container-title":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244020988293","ISSN":"2158-2440","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"2158244020988293","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Directionality of Atmospheric Water in Chinese: A Lexical Semantic Study Based on Linguistic Ontology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244020988293","volume":"11"},

This series of interconnected essays and lectures surveys the most critically important and hotly contested issues in Hinduism over 3,500 years, from the ancient time of the Vedas to the present day. The essays contemplate the nature of Hinduism; Hindu concepts of divinity; attitudes concerning gender, control, and desire; the question of reality and illusion; and the impermanent and the eternal in the two great Sanskrit epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Among the questions Doniger considers are: Are Hindus monotheists or polytheists? How can atheists be Hindu, and how can unrepentant Hindu sinners find salvation? Why have Hindus devoted so much attention to the psychology of addiction? What does the significance of dogs and cows tell us about Hinduism? How have Hindu concepts of death, rebirth, and karma changed over the course of history? How and why does a pluralistic faith, remarkable for its intellectual tolerance, foster religious intolerance? Doniger concludes with four concise autobiographical essays in which she reflects on her lifetime of scholarship, Hindu criticism of her work, and the influence of Hinduism on her own philosophy of life.

While the Chinese were initially unclear on how to incorporate the chili into their diets and how to compare it alongside their native plants (was it like the Sichuan pepper, ginger, eggplant, or black pepper?), the chili and its versatility became so essential to Chinese cuisine and pharmacopeia that it quickly became indigenized and was later used as an example for native plant identification. As the distinction between foreign and indigenous faded, the influence and popularity of the chili grew, redefining the term \"spicy\" and appearing in a wide variety of literary texts and art. The cultural symbolism surrounding the chili has even tied the pepper to Mao Zedong as revolutionary imagery, and it continues to be used in Chinese pop culture as a symbol of regional and national identity\"","author":[{"family":"Dott","given":"Brian Russell"}],"call-number":"SB307.P4 D68 2020","citation-key":"dott_chile_2020","collection-title":"Arts and traditions of the table : perspectives on culinary history","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-19532-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Chile Pepper in China: A Cultural Biography","title-short":"The Chile Pepper in China","type":"book","URL":"http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-chile-pepper-in-china/9780231195324"},

How can we transcend the exigencies of daily life? How can we achieve sufficient distance from our own everyday realities to think and act more sustainably? To address these questions, Michael R. Dove draws on the results of decades of research in South and Southeast Asia on how local cultures have circumvented the \"curse of consciousness\"-the paradox that we cannot completely comprehend the ecosystem of which we are part. He distills from his ethnographic, ecological, and historical research three principles: perspectivism (seeing oneself from outside oneself), metamorphosis (becoming something that one is not), and mimesis (copying something that one is not), which help a society to transcend the hubris and myopia of everyday existence and achieve greater insight into its ecosystem.","author":[{"family":"Dove","given":"Michael R."}],"citation-key":"dove_bitter_2021","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv1dv0vjt","ISBN":"978-0-300-25174-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Yale University Press","title":"Bitter Shade: The Ecological Challenge of Human Consciousness","type":"Book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1dv0vjt"},

  {"id":"duffy_food_2000","abstract":"Objective To determine if individuals who taste 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), one marker of genetic variation in taste, as exceptionally bitter can also perceive sugars as sweeter, other bitters as more intense, and dietary fats as more creamy and/or viscous than do individuals who taste PROP as weakly bitter. This study examined the association between genetic variation in taste and acceptance for sweet, high-fat, and bitter foods and beverages. Design Genetic variation was measured by perceived bitterness of PROP. (influenced by genetic, hormonal, and pathologic factors) and density of fungi form papillae on the anterior portion of the tongue (influenced primarily by genetic factors). Four sweet, 3 fat, and 3 bitter groups were derived from principal components analyses of questionnaire items. Subjects Convenience sample of healthy adults (24 women, 22 men; mean age±standard deviation=21±6 years) who did not report high dietary restraint. Statistical analyses Pearson product moment correlations between genetic taste measures and food and beverage groups. Results The sample showed diversity in genetic taste measures: perceived bitterness of 0.0032mol/L PROP ranged from “weak” to well above “very strong”; fungi form papillae densities ranged from 33 to 156 papillae per square centimeter. Distribution of perceived bitterness of PROP and fungi form papillae density differed in women and men. The association between genetic taste measures and acceptance of sweet and high-fat groups differed in women and men. In women, liking of sweet and high-fat food and beverage groups decreased with increasing perceived bitterness of PROP. In men, liking of these foods and beverages increased but with increasing papillae densities. Genetic taste measures were not associated with a dislike of bitter food and beverage groups. Applications The influence of genetic variation in taste on food intake depends on how perceptible sweet, fat, or bitter components are in foods and beverages, as well as the value of sensory factors vs other factors (eg, health, convenience) on personal dietary choices. Female supertasters of PROP bitterness may avoid high-fat or sweet foods because these oral sensations are too intense and thus less pleasant. Supertasters may taste more bitterness in vegetables but still enjoy eating them because of their healthfulness and because condiments (especially those that are salt based) can block bitterness.

This Element shows how text classification and text similarity models can extend our ability to undertake corpus linguistics across very large corpora. These computational methods are becoming increasingly important as corpora grow too large for more traditional types of linguistic analysis. We draw on five case studies to show how and why to use computational methods, ranging from usage-based grammar to authorship analysis to using social media for corpus-based sociolinguistics. Each section is accompanied by an interactive code notebook that shows how to implement the analysis in Python. A stand-alone Python package is also available to help readers use these methods with their own data.

  {"id":"durkin_oxford_2015","abstract":"This book provides a guide to the most significant contours in the geography of the lexicographical world, as well as offering series of eye-witness accounts of the major issues confronting lexicographers and the users of dictionaries today. Part I considers the synchronic dictionary, and especially three characteristic types: (1) the dictionary for the general readership (many peoples conception of the dictionary); (2) the monolingual dictionary intended for L2 learners; and (3) the bilingual dictionary. These are placed together so that, after their distinctive features have been set out, common areas of methodology can be considered together, in particular the central role of the corpus in lexicography of this type today. Such dictionaries are normally also synchronic, and are typically intended for a mass market, and produced by commercial publishers. Part II deals with historical dictionaries, typically edited within an academic institution and published by an academic press, and typically intended for a more specialist readership. A diachronic perspective produces particular structural and presentational challenges, so that one can identify methods and procedures that distinguish diachronic lexicography from synchronic lexicography. In Part III a set of slightly shorter chapters examine some of the most important types of specialist dictionaries and their salient qualities and methodologies, focusing on what sets each area apart, but also on the perspectives it brings to the wider lexicographical world. Part IV examines some topics common to various different types of lexicography, and some of the challenges and debates that cross the boundaries of sub-fields.","author":[{"family":"Durkin","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"durkin_oxford_2015","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-969163-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"The Oxford Handbook of Lexicography","type":"book"},

Its popularity is clearly inﬂuenced by the introduction of Google’s Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a deﬁnition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google’s Knowledge Graph, although no oﬃcial documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a deﬁnition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and deﬁning the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a deﬁnition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.","author":[{"family":"Ehrlinger","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wöß","given":"Wolfram"}],"citation-key":"ehrlinger_definition_","language":"en","page":"4","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards a Deﬁnition of Knowledge Graphs","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"elshamsy_rediscovering_2020","abstract":"\"Historians have traced the traditions of Islamic scholarship back to late antiquity. Muslim scholars were at work as early as 750 CE/AD, painstakingly copying their commentaries and legal opinions onto scrolls and codices. This venerable tradition embraced the modern printing press relatively late-movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century. Islamic scholars, however, initially kept their distance from the new technology, and it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the first published editions of works of classical religious scholarship began to appear in print. As the culture of print took root, both popular and scholarly understandings of the Islamic tradition shifted. Particular religious works were soon read precisely because they were available in printed, published editions. Other equally erudite works still in scroll and manuscript form, by contrast, languished in the obscurity of manuscript repositories. The people who selected, edited, and published the new print books on and about Islam exerted a huge influence on the resulting literary tradition. These unheralded editors determined, essentially, what came to be understood by the early twentieth century as the classical written \"canon\" of Islamic thought. Collectively, this relatively small group of editors who brought Islamic literature into print crucially shaped how Muslim intellectuals, the Muslim public, and various Islamist movements understood the Islamic intellectual tradition. In this book Ahmed El Shamsy recounts this sea change, focusing on the Islamic literary culture of Cairo, a hot spot of the infant publishing industry, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As El Shamsy argues, the aforementioned editors included some of the greatest minds in the Muslim world and shared an ambitious intellectual agenda of revival, reform, and identity formation. This book tells the stories of the most consequential of these editors as well as their relations and intellectual exchanges with the European orientalists who also contributed to the new Islamic print culture\"--","author":[{"family":"El Shamsy","given":"Ahmed"}],"call-number":"Z466.E486","citation-key":"elshamsy_rediscovering_2020","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-20124-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Rediscovering the Islamic Classics: How Editors and Print Culture Transformed an Intellectual Tradition","title-short":"Rediscovering the Islamic classics","type":"book"},

Bubbly, as we affectionately call it, is a symbol of luxury and decadence and the go-to drink whenever there is an important toast. This history from Becky Sue Epstein is a celebration of the world's most celebratory drink. Here, Epstein chronicles champagne's story, from the world's first sparkling wine, produced in Limoux, Languedoc, in 1531 by monks at an abbey in Saint-Hilaire to the celebrities who made champagnes famous and continue to do so today-- from Dom Perignon to the widow Veuve Cliquot. Most important, Epstein fully explains the distinction between champagne and sparkling wine. In this informative chronicle, she answers whether French champagne is really better than other sparkling wines and elucidates the science behind that characteristic fizz and bubble. She takes the reader on a tour of vineyards in wine regions around the world and teaches the correct techniques for storing and serving champagne and sparkling wines. Whether you prefer magnums of Cristal or the affordable thrill of Cold Duck, Champagne is an invaluable complement to any bubbly glass and an informative, elegant gift for connoisseurs, beginners, and wine lovers of all kinds\"--Provided by publisher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Becky Sue"}],"citation-key":"epstein_champagne_2011","collection-title":"Edible","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-86189-963-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 767502736","publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Champagne: a global history","title-short":"Champagne","type":"book","URL":"http://www.dawsonera.com/depp/reader/protected/external/AbstractView/S9781861899637"},

  {"id":"eriksson_genetic_2012","abstract":"The leaves of the Coriandrum sativum plant, known as cilantro or coriander, are widely used in many cuisines around the world. However, far from being a benign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while others claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy or pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in cilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to date nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry who reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set of 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste detection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP, rs72921001, (p=6.4e-9, odds ratio 0.81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes is OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes that give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability of cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability tagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is a genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro dislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that OR6A2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a soapy smell from cilantro in European populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shirley"},{"family":"Do","given":"Chuong B."},{"family":"Kiefer","given":"Amy K."},{"family":"Tung","given":"Joyce Y."},{"family":"Mountain","given":"Joanna L."},{"family":"Hinds","given":"David A."},{"family":"Francke","given":"Uta"}],"citation-key":"eriksson_genetic_2012","container-title":"arXiv:1209.2096 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,10]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Genetic Variant Near Olfactory Receptor Genes Influences Cilantro Preference","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2096"},

We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like “bleed” and “punch” to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern ﬁction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered ﬁlter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath’s data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fast","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Binbin"},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Michael S."}],"citation-key":"fast_empath_2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/2858036.2858535","event-place":"San Jose California USA","event-title":"CHI'16: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3362-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,7]]},"language":"en","page":"4647-4657","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"San Jose California USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Empath: Understanding Topic Signals in Large-Scale Text","title-short":"Empath","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2858036.2858535"},

All product experiences rely on information from sensory modalities. We developed a questionnaire approach to quantify the relative importance of the ﬁve sensory modalities for various descriptors of product experience. The approach was used in two studies that employed Dutch and Russian participants. The results demonstrate that the importance of a sensory modality differs for various groups of descriptors. Most symbolic descriptors demonstrated strong visual dominance. Affective descriptors were equally related to all sensory modalities. Sensory descriptors showed signiﬁcant cross-cultural differences. The latter result can be explained by the different associations between literal and metaphorical meanings of sensory adjectives in different languages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenko","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Otten","given":"Jacco J."},{"family":"Schifferstein","given":"Hendrik N.J."}],"citation-key":"fenko_describing_2010","container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2010.05.010","ISSN":"03782166","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12]]},"language":"en","page":"3314-3327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Describing product experience in different languages: The role of sensory modalities","title-short":"Describing product experience in different languages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378216610001724","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"ferrence_therapy_2004","abstract":"This paper presents a new interpretation of a unique Bronze Age (c. 3000–1100 BCE) Aegean wall painting in the building of Xeste 3 at Akrotiri,Thera. Crocus cartwrightianus and its active principle, saffron, are the primary subjects at Xeste 3. Several lines of evidence suggest that the meaning of these frescoes concerns saffron and healing: (1) the unusual degree of visual attention given to the crocus, including the variety of methods for display of the stigmas; (2) the painted depiction of the line of saffron production from plucking blooms to the collection of stigmas; and (3) the sheer number (ninety) of medical indications for which saffron has been used from the Bronze Age to the present.The Xeste 3 frescoes appear to portray a divinity of healing associated with her phytotherapy, saffron. Cultural and commercial interconnections between the Therans, the Aegean world, and their neighboring civilizations in the early 2nd millennium BCE indicate a close network of thematic exchange, but there is no evidence that Akrotiri borrowed any of these medicinal (or iconographic) representations.The complex production line, the monumental illustration of a goddess of medicine with her saffron attribute, and this earliest botanically accurate image of an herbal medication are all Theran innovations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrence","given":"Susan C."},{"family":"Bendersky","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"ferrence_therapy_2004","container-title":"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1353/pbm.2004.0026","ISSN":"1529-8795","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","page":"199-226","title":"Therapy with Saffron and the Goddess at Thera","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/perspectives_in_biology_and_medicine/v047/47.2ferrence.html","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"florida_writing_1995","abstract":"Located at the juncture of literature, history, and anthropology, Writing the Past, Inscribing the Future charts a strategy of how one might read a traditional text of non-Western historical literature in order to generate, with it, an opening for the future. This book does so by taking seriously a haunting work of historical prophecy inscribed in the nineteenth century by a royal Javanese exile-working through this writing of a colonized past to suggest the reconfiguration of the postcolonial future that this history itself apparently intends. After introducing the colonial and postcolonial orientalist projects that would fix the meaning of traditional writing in Java, Nancy K. Florida provides a nuanced translation of this particular traditional history, a history composed in poetry as the dream of a mysterious exile. She then undertakes a richly textured reading of the poem that discloses how it manages to escape the fixing of \"tradition.\" Adopting a dialogic strategy of reading, Florida writes to extend-as the work's Javanese author demands-this history's prophetic potential into a more global register. Babad Jaka Tingkir, the historical prophecy that Writing the Past, Inscribing the Future translates and reads, is uniquely suited for such a study. Composing an engaging history of the emergence of Islamic power in central Java around the turn of the sixteenth century, Babad Jaka Tingkir was written from the vantage of colonial exile to contest the more dominant dynastic historical traditions of nineteenth-century court literature.

The case study is an ancient traveling narrative, Pausanias’s Description of Greece (Periegesis Hellados) which was written in the second century CE. First, we describe the process of converting the volumes to spatial data using a customized version of the open-source digital semantic annotation platform Recogito. Then the focus shifts to the implementation of collected and organized spatial data to a number of GIS applications: namely Google Maps, DARIAH Geo-Browser, Gephi, Palladio and ArcGIS. Through empirical experimentation with spatial data and their implementation in different platforms, our paper charts the ways in which contemporary GIS applications may be implemented to cast new light on ancient understandings of identity, space, and place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Foka","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Demiroglu","given":"Osman Cenk"},{"family":"Barker","given":"Elton"},{"family":"Mostofian","given":"Nasrin"},{"family":"Konstantinidou","given":"Kyriaki"},{"family":"Kiesling","given":"Brady"},{"family":"Talatas","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Palm","given":"Kajsa"}],"citation-key":"foka_visualizing_2022","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqab093","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,23]]},"language":"en","page":"716-724","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visualizing Pausanias’s <i>Description of Greece</i> with contemporary GIS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/37/3/716/6439579","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"fourrier_methodological_","abstract":"Diachronic lexical information was mostly used in its natural ﬁeld, historical linguistics, until recently, when promising but not yet conclusive applications to low resource languages machine translation started extending its usage to NLP. There is therefore a new need for ﬁne-grained, large-coverage and accurate etymological lexical resources. In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to generate such resources, for each step of the life-cycle of an etymological lexicon: creation, update, evaluation, dissemination, and exploitation. To illustrate the guidelines, we introduce EtymDB 2.0, an etymological database automatically generated from the Wiktionary, which contains 1.8 million lexemes, linked by more than 700,000 ﬁne-grained etymological relations, across 2,536 living and dead languages. We also introduce use cases for which EtymDB 2.0 could represent a key resource, such as phylogenetic tree generation, low resource machine translation and medieval languages study.","author":[{"family":"Fourrier","given":"Clémentine"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"}],"citation-key":"fourrier_methodological_","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Methodological Aspects of Developing and Managing an Etymological Lexical Resource: Introducing EtymDB 2.0","type":"article-journal"},

In addition spices provided an image of wellness and as they were expensive and had many uses in cuisine and fragrance, they functioned as prestige consumer goods. Materials and methods This is an effort to look historically at a social and cultural phenomenon for the period roughly A.D. 1200–1500. Sources of information about the demand for and uses of spices include lists of materia medica, medical treatises, cookbooks, religious writings, descriptions of banquets and court ceremonial and literary works showing what might be called aspirational lifestyles. Results It is important to focus on the demand side of the spice trade rather than simply assuming a consistent demand and looking only at the supply (prices, routes, for example). Conclusions The demand for spices must be understood in terms of their attributed medical and wellness powers, but these in turn are related to the mysterious Eastern origins of spices that enhanced their image as elite consumer products and their association with spiritual as well as medical healing.","author":[{"family":"Freedman","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"freedman_health_2015","container-title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.10.065","ISSN":"0378-8741","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"47-53","title":"Health, Wellness and the Allure of Spices in the Middle Ages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114008058","volume":"167"},

Why chile peppers? Both a spice and a vegetable, chile peppers have captivated imaginations and taste buds for thousands of years. Native to Mesoamerica and the New World, chiles are currently grown on every continent, since their relatively recent introduction to Europe (in the early 1500s via Christopher Columbus). Chiles are delicious, dynamic, and very diverse-they have been rapidly adopted, adapted, and assimilated into numerous world cuisines, and while malleable to a degree, certain heirloom varieties are deeply tied to place and culture-but now accelerating climate change may be scrambling their terroir. Over a year-long journey, three pepper-loving gastronauts-an agroecologist, a chef, and an ethnobotanist-set out to find the real stories of America's rarest heirloom chile varieties, and learn about the changing climate from farmers and other people who live by the pepper, and who, lately, have been adapting to shifting growing conditions and weather patterns. They put a face on an issue that has been made far too abstract for our own good.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Friese","given":"Kurt Michael"},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Kraig"},{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Gary Paul"}],"citation-key":"friese_chasing_2011","event-place":"White River Junction, Vermont","ISBN":"978-1-60358-375-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 894237955","publisher":"Chelsea Green Publishing","publisher-place":"White River Junction, Vermont","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Chasing Chiles: Hot Spots Along the Pepper Trail","title-short":"Chasing chiles","type":"book","URL":"https://archive.org/details/chasingchileshot0000frie"},

In this book, Barbara Gallani looks at the differences and similarities between the ways dumplings are prepared in a variety of cultures, addressing the contrast between the dumpling as an everyday meal and as a food for festive occasions.

  {"id":"gaynor_piracy_2012","abstract":"[This article uses the offing as a metaphor to theorize piracy in relation to pivotal moments in Southeast Asia's maritime engagement with the world. \"In the offing\" usually indicates that something is about to happen. This figurative meaning derives from a literal one that refers to the visible sea beyond inshore navigational hazards. Nautically apt, the offing's literal sense also provides a useful metaphor for analyzing piracy. Like the physical location of the offing, piracy entails both an embodied orientation as well as a more general relation of structured perceptions between those aboard ship and those on shore. Yet shore-based political authorities have had an inordinate power to define what counts as piracy and who is determined to be a pirate. While designations of piracy illuminate the efforts of states to manage the limits of their sovereignty, the boundary between legitimate plunder and that which is not has often been negotiated across social arenas in which legal (and other) legitimacies are differentially acknowledged. Like the space of the offing, acts that might be considered piracy and those who do them thus entail questions of definition, visibility, and point of view—matters that for piracy unfold in relation to particular configurations of politics, power, and cultural comprehension. The question of piracy comes under scrutiny here in three such configurations: first, in the relations between Southeast Asian polities and between them and China during the 15th century; second, in the context of early 17th century Dutch trade in Southeast Asia along with the European political and legal setting; and third, in connection with 19th century views on piracy's proliferation in the region and inter-colonial attempts to curb it. This analysis informs a discussion of infamous ethnic names that signified \"pirates\" in colonial European and Southeast Asian discourses. It then also anchors critical observations about contemporary piracy and the notion of failed states.]","author":[{"family":"Gaynor","given":"Jennifer L."}],"citation-key":"gaynor_piracy_2012","container-title":"Anthropological Quarterly","ISSN":"00035491, 15341518","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"817-857","title":"Piracy in the Offing: The Law of Lands and The Limits of Sovereignty at Sea","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41857272","volume":"85"},

This assumes Wittgenstein inverted the relation between being a member of a family and bearing family resemblances to others of that family. (The Churchills bear family resemblances to one another because they belong to the same family, they don't belong to the same family because they resemble one another.) A close reading of Investigations gives no evidence that Wittgenstein made this mistake. Rather, family resemblances may play a role like the one criteria play for psychological terms.

  {"id":"gilboa_beginnings_2015","abstract":"When did the trade in lucrative spices from South Asia to the West commence? Recent organic residue analyses performed on small early Iron Age (11th–late 10th century BCE) Phoenician clay flasks provide the first concrete archaeological evidence that such sustainable trade took place much earlier than hitherto suspected. The analysis shows that several of the flasks contained cinnamon, which in this period could only have originated in South/Southeast Asia.

As well as 40,000 headwords and 100,000 senses, the dictionary includes a vast collection of illustrative quotations taken from the canon of classical literature, each now conveniently arranged under the appropriate sense or subsense. In addition, the newly digitized text incorporates a significant amount of editorial updating, including revised English translations, expansion of many abbreviations, and clearer labelling throughout the text. The new design is a masterpiece of concision and clarity and the entire text is handsomely bound in two volumes.

We design a simple computer model following the Pólya-urn dynamics to evaluate possible effects of linguistic, individual learning, and socio-cultural factors on linguistic diffusion. Simulation results and statistical analyses collectively reveal that: variant prestige, rather than individual bias, is a fundamental selective pressure for diffusion; given variant prestige, speaker’s and hearer’s preferences for prestigious variants show different degrees of efficiency on diffusion; and structural features of social network, such as average degree and level of centrality, also modulate the degree of diffusion.

Silk weaving is evident from the Shang period c. 1600–1045 BC, though the earliest evidence for silk textiles in ancient China may date to as much as a millennium earlier. Recent microscopic analysis of archaeological thread fragments found inside copper-alloy ornaments from Harappa and steatite beads from Chanhu-daro, two important Indus sites, have yielded silk ﬁbres, dating to c. 2450–2000 BC. This study offers the earliest evidence in the world for any silk outside China, and is roughly contemporaneous with the earliest Chinese evidence for silk. This important new ﬁnding brings into question the traditional historical notion of sericulture as being an exclusively Chinese invention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Good","given":"I.

  {"id":"graeber_dawn_2021","abstract":"A trailblazing account of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution--from the development of agriculture and cities to the emergence of \"the state,\" political violence, and social inequality--and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation. For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike--either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

  {"id":"green_persianate_2019","abstract":"Persian is one of the great lingua francas of world history. Yet despite its recognition as a shared language across the Islamic world and beyond, its scope, impact, and mechanisms remain underexplored. A world historical inquiry into pre-modern cosmopolitanism, The Persianate World traces the reach and limits of Persian as a Eurasian language in a comprehensive survey of its geographical, literary, and social frontiers. From Siberia to Southeast Asia, and between London and Beijing, this book shows how Persian gained, maintained, and finally surrendered its status to imperial and vernacular competitors. Fourteen essays trace Persian’s interactions with Bengali, Chinese, Turkic, Punjabi, and other languages to identify the forces that extended “Persographia,” the domain of written Persian. Spanning the ages of expansion and contraction, The Persianate World offers a critical survey of both the supports and constraints of one of history’s key languages of global exchange. “This groundbreaking collection illuminates the multifaceted and very complex history of the rise and decline of the Persian language as a lingua franca.” AHMAD KARIMI-HAKKAK, author of Recasting Persian Poetry “With erudition and refinement, this book accomplishes something remarkable—it provides a timely corrective to an anachronistic understanding of the Persianate sphere as an empire of letters centred on Iran.” PAOLO SARTORI, author of Visions of Justice “An exceptionally important contribution to our understanding of what constituted the Persianate world.” ANDREW PEACOCK, University of St. Andrews NILE GREEN holds the Ibn Khaldun Endowed Chair in World History at the University of California, Los Angeles.

  {"id":"gresta_saffron_2008","abstract":"Saﬀron (Crocus sativus L.) is an autumnal ﬂowering geophite whose dried stigmas, well known for their aromatic and colouring power, have been used since immemorial time as a spice in human nutrition, for medicinal purposes and as a dye. Many doubts remain on its origin; it was probably selected and domesticated in Crete during the Late Bronze Age. Saﬀron is an autotriploid geophyte species, self- and out-sterile and mostly male-sterile and therefore unable to produce seed, that reproduces by means of corms. Furthermore, it has a reverse biological cycle compared with the majority of cultivated and spontaneous plants: ﬂowering ﬁrst in October-November, then vegetative development until May, which means that the vegetative development is not directly important for production of stigmas, but for the production of new corms. Due to its unique biological, physiological and agronomic traits, saﬀron is able to exploit marginal land and to be included in low-input cropping systems, representing an alternative viable crop for sustainable agriculture. Notwithstanding this great potential and the considerable increase in new generation consumer demand for saﬀron, the future of the plant is still uncertain. Indeed, the main obstacles to saﬀron production are: (1) the limited areas of cultivation in countries where it is traditionally grown, (2) the great amount of sophisticated spice, (3) management techniques executed by hand, and (4) the very high price of the spice. Here we review the main biological, genetic and ecological traits associated with agronomic management techniques of saﬀron in relation to environmental conditions. Colour, taste and aroma are the essential features on which the quality of saﬀron stigmas is founded. In turn, these aspects are strictly connected with the biomolecular composition of the stigmas, namely, the carotenoids and their derivatives. With this in mind, the biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of saﬀron secondary metabolites and their abundance in the spice is presented, together with the biomedical properties commonly associated with saﬀron. Furthermore, a detailed overview of the more recent instrumental methods to assess the quality of saﬀron, strictly from a chemical point of view, will be discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gresta","given":"F."},{"family":"Lombardo","given":"G.

  {"id":"gruenwald_cinnamon_2010","abstract":"Cinnamon has been used as a spice and as traditional herbal medicine for centuries. The available in vitro and animal in vivo evidence suggests that cinnamon has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, cardiovascular, cholesterol-lowering, and immunomodulatory effects. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cinnamon may act as an insulin mimetic, to potentiate insulin activity or to stimulate cellular glucose metabolism. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated strong hypoglycemic properties. However, there are only very few well-controlled clinical studies, a fact that limits the conclusions that can be made about the potential health benefits of cinnamon for free-living humans. The use of cinnamon as an adjunct to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most promising area, but further research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made.","author":[{"family":"Gruenwald","given":"Joerg"},{"family":"Freder","given":"Janine"},{"family":"Armbruester","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"gruenwald_cinnamon_2010","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408390902773052","ISSN":"1040-8398","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"822-834","title":"Cinnamon and Health","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408390902773052","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"grzega_adieu_","abstract":"The article gives a chronological overview of the leave-taking terms in English language history. In a second approach the leave-taking terms are classified according to the motivation that is the basis for a specific coinage. Expressive expressions, wishes for God’s protection and wishes for a good time or health are shown to be especially prominent. Furthermore, there are a few loan expressions. The article also tries to explain words and phrases whose origin is unclear: 73 is shown to be an unmotivated, accidental Morse expression; So long is considered a Norwegian loan translation; evidence is given to see the origin Good-bye in the phrase God buy you. It also shows that many phrases become phonetically reduced (and opaque) and/or functionally “deprived”, which forces the speech community (or particular groups) to invent new phrases.","author":[{"family":"Grzega","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"grzega_adieu_","language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"ADIEU, BYE-BYE, CHEERIO:","type":"article-journal"},

It offers a comprehensive catalog of forces for lexical, or lexemic, change and places these forces on a conscious—subconscious continuum. It then establishes a frequency ranking of these forces. The ranking is based on a corpus of 281 lexical innovations in the history of formal English. The most salient forces turn out to be fashion/prestige (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion), anthropological salience (i.e. anthropologically given emotionality of a concept), social reasons (i.e. contact situation with “undemarcation” effects), and the desire for plasticity (creation of saliently and “noticeably” motivated name).","author":[{"family":"Grzega","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"grzega_qualitative_","language":"en","page":"41","source":"Zotero","title":"A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PRESENTATION OF THE FORCES FOR LEXEMIC CHANGE IN THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH","type":"article-journal"},

By analyzing multiple examples from a semasiological and an onomasiological perspective it is shown that the roles of prototypes and prototypical meanings are sometimes overestimated. Apart from illustrating that it is possible to distinguish at least two sorts of prototypes (\"real-world\" prototypes vs. \"ideal-world\" prototypes), the lexical analyses show that not infrequently other factors seem more relevant for the vertical taxonomic changes brought into discussion: evolution of \"generic neutrals\"; conceptual fields as centers of attraction; conceptual recategorization; the lexical conservativeness of specific frames, certain collocations or word-formations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Grzega","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"grzega_using_2003","container-title":"<i>WORD</i>","container-title-short":"<i>WORD</i>","DOI":"10.1080/00437956.2003.11432537","ISSN":"0043-7956, 2373-5112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,12]]},"language":"en","page":"335-357","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On using (and misusing) prototypes for explanations of lexical changes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00437956.2003.11432537","volume":"54"},

At this early embryonic stage of the project, we report about the design, the architecture and some of the experiments which we have conducted on HAC. The corpus, and accordingly the search results, will be represented using a primary XML exchange format. This will serve as an intermediate exchange tool within the project and will allow the user to process the results offline using some external tools. HAC. is made up of Classical Arabic texts that cover 1600 years of language use; the Quranic text, Modern Standard Arabic texts, as well as a variety of monolingual Arabic dictionaries. The development of this historical corpus assists linguists and Arabic language learners to effectively explore, understand, and discover interesting knowledge hidden in millions of instances of language use. We used techniques from the field of natural language processing to process the data and a graph-based representation for the corpus. We provided researchers with an export facility to render further linguistic analysis possible.","author":[{"family":"Hammo","given":"Bassam"},{"family":"Yagi","given":"Sane"},{"family":"Ismail","given":"Omaima"},{"family":"AbuShariah","given":"Mohammad"}],"citation-key":"hammo_exploring_2016","container-title":"Language Resources and Evaluation","ISSN":"1574020X, 15728412","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"839-861","title":"Exploring and Exploiting a Historical Corpus for Arabic","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/44131458","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"hansen_year_2020","abstract":"\"In history, myth often abides. It was long assumed that the centuries immediately prior to AD 1000 were lacking in any major cultural developments or geopolitical encounters, that the Europeans hadn't yet discovered North America, that the farthest anyone had traveled over sea was the Vikings' invasion of Britain. But how, then, to explain the presence of blonde-haired people in Mayan temple murals in Chichen Itza, Mexico? Could it be possible that the Vikings had found their way to the Americas during the height of the Mayan empire? Valerie Hansen, a much-honored historian, argues that the year 1000 was the world's first point of major cultural exchange and exploration. Drawing on nearly thirty years of research on medieval China and global history, she presents a compelling account of first encounters between disparate societies. As people on at least five continents ventured outward, they spread technology, new crops, and religion. These encounters, she shows, made it possible for Christopher Columbus to reach the Americas in 1492, and set the stage for the process of globalization that so dominates the modern era. For readers of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens, The Year 1000 is an intellectually daring, provocative account that will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about how the modern world came to be. It will also hold up a mirror to the hopes and fears we experience today.\"--","author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Valerie"}],"call-number":"D123 .H37 2020","citation-key":"hansen_year_2020","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-5011-9412-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Scribner","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Year 1000: When Globalization Began","title-short":"The Year 1000","type":"book"},

  {"id":"harris_going_2020","abstract":"Before the seventeenth century, trade across Eurasia was mostly conducted in short segments along the Silk Route and Indian Ocean. Business was organized in family firms, merchant networks, and state-owned enterprises, and dominated by Chinese, Indian, and Arabic traders. However, around 1600 the first two joint-stock corporations, the English and Dutch East India Companies, were established.<em>Going the Distance</em> tells the story of overland and maritime trade without Europeans, of European Cape Route trade without corporations, and of how new, large-scale, and impersonal organizations arose in Europe to control long-distance trade for more than three centuries. Ron Harris shows that by 1700, the scene and methods for global trade had dramatically changed: Dutch and English merchants shepherded goods directly from China and India to northwestern Europe. To understand this transformation, Harris compares the organizational forms used in four major regions: China, India, the Middle East, and Western Europe. The English and Dutch were the last to leap into Eurasian trade, and they innovated in order to compete. They raised capital from passive investors through impersonal stock markets and their joint-stock corporations deployed more capital, ships, and agents to deliver goods from their origins to consumers. <em>Going the Distance</em> explores the history behind a cornerstone of the modern economy, and how this organizational revolution contributed to the formation of global trade and the creation of the business corporation as a key factor in Europe's economic rise.","author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"R.

  {"id":"harris_linguistics_2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            This book centers on a key rupture in the field of linguistics as a hegemony by the theories of Noam Chomsky appeared to be taking hold, a rupture in the 1960s that began a flowering of alternate approaches to Chomsky's framework, but also reoriented his framework markedly. The rupture was between Generative Semantics, which pushed to include more and more meaning in linguistic theory, and Interpretive Semantics, which resisted that push, putting more and more weight on syntactic structure. But in many ways the dispute can be reduced to George Lakoff, the most prominent voice on the more-meaning side, and Chomsky on the more-syntax side. Chomsky is a big personality, quiet and understated but always gesturing at monumental, revolutionary implications for his ideas, and always bringing great numbers of linguists along with him whenever he chases after those implications, stirring up psychology, philosophy, computer science, and other fields in the bargain. Lakoff is also big personality, anything but quiet or understated, equally comfortable gesturing at grand revolutions, equally happy to stir things up. They drive the story, but the story is about theories, data, and various technical developments, set among social currents that range from military industrial politics to the counterculture. All of these factors show up in the book, with a cast of other remarkable and influential characters. Noam Chomsky is unquestionably the most influential linguist of the twentieth century—many people claim of any century—whose work and personal imprint remains powerfully relevant today, so the book culminates with an analysis of Chomsky’s influence and legacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Randy Allen"}],"citation-key":"harris_linguistics_2021","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780199740338.001.0001","edition":"2","ISBN":"978-0-19-974033-8 978-0-19-760866-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,11]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Linguistics Wars: Chomsky, Lakoff, and the Battle over Deep Structure","title-short":"The Linguistics Wars","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/39137"},

  {"id":"haw_cinnamon_2017","abstract":"Abstract: There is a widespread assumption that ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as the spices now known by those names that is, products obtained from trees of the genus Cinnamomum. This article argues that this is not the case, but that the “cinnamon” and “cassia” of ancient writers very probably came from plants native to northeast Africa, as several early writers actually state. Possible African sources of ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” are suggested. The most probable principal source is identified as Cassia abbreviata. It is also argued that alleged identifications of cinnamon or cassia at archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region are questionable. It is shown that cinnamon and cassia did not figure in Southeast Asian and Chinese trade at an early period, and that Austronesian settlement of Madagascar occurred after the Classical period, probably during the second half of the first millennium CE, too late for Southeast Asians to have played any major role in trade with the Roman Empire. There is no good reason to believe that true cinnamon and cassia were traded to the western Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean region at any very early date. This article truly takes an interdisciplinary approach to its subject: the author is a botanist as well as a historian, and is able to use original Chinese sources. The question of whether ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as modern cinnamon and cassia (products of trees of the genus Cinnamomum) is a thorny one, which has been repeatedly debated in the past, usually with no very conclusive result. The most recent thorough discussion of the issue, by Lionel Casson, concluded that the ancient and modern products were the same. This article refutes that view: it is clear that Casson lacked the botanical knowledge necessary to reach a sound conclusion. The article deals with its subject thoroughly, examining archaeological as well as textual evidence, and using a wide range of sources.","author":[{"family":"Haw","given":"Stephen George"}],"citation-key":"haw_cinnamon_2017","container-title":"Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology","DOI":"10.14795/j.v4i1.211","ISSN":"2360-266X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"5-18","publisher":"Mega Publishing House","title":"Cinnamon, Cassia and Ancient Trade","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

The construction technique of the ship appears to resemble that of the eastern Indian Ocean, not the western Indian Ocean.

This article takes issue with one such misinterpretation, the anachronistic view that the Strait of Melaka has been the principal sea route connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea throughout most of recorded history. Beginning at a period when an overland journey across the Malay Peninsula was an essential link in the routes connecting South, Southeast and East Asia, it is suggested that the ﬁrst entirely maritime itinerary to be used regularly passed through the Sunda Strait. Changes in itineraries affected the fortunes of the states of Southeast Asia, particularly of Funan and Srivijaya.","author":[{"family":"Haw","given":"Stephen G."}],"citation-key":"haw_maritime_2017","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

This version of history was rejected some time ago, and replaced with an account that begins with a Mongol invasion of Tibet in 1240. Problems with clarifying this issue include the often poor quality of Tibetan sources, the confusion of Tibet and Tangut (Xi Xia) in Persian sources, and misunderstanding by modern scholars of Chinese terms relating to Tibet. In fact, Chinese sources make clear that there was considerable contact between the Mongols and Tibet before 1240. Chinggis Khan may never have invaded Tibet, but undoubtedly had the intention of doing so. The picture that emerges is of a gradual conquest, with early incursions across the borders of Tibet followed by more penetrating invasions in the 1240s and 1250s.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Haw","given":"Stephen G."}],"citation-key":"haw_mongol_2014","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

  {"id":"hayes_supertasting_2008","abstract":"Polymorphisms in the TAS2R38 gene provide insight to phenotypes long associated 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide bitterness. We tested relationships between TAS2R38 genotype, taste phenotype, and fungiform papillae (FP) number in 139 females and 59 males (age range 21–60 years), primarily of European ancestry. DNA was analyzed for 3 polymorphic sites, identifying common (alanine–valine–isoleucine [AVI/AVI], heterozygotes, proline–alanine–valine [PAV/PAV]) and rare (proline–valine–isoleucine, alanine–alanine–valine, AAI) forms. Individuals with PROP threshold >0.15 mM were almost exclusively AVI/AVI; those with threshold <0.1 mM could have any genotype. PAV/PAVs were more difficult to identify with PROP taste measures, although perceived bitterness of moderate PROP concentrations (0.32, 1 mM) had better correspondence with genotype than did threshold. For AVI/AVIs, increases in bitterness from 1 to 3.2 mM PROP nearly paralleled those of TAS2R38 heterozygotes and PAV/PAVs. Some bitterness gains were related to FP number sampled from a standard area on the tongue tip, yet the PROP bitterness–FP relationship differed across genotype. Among homozygotes, FP was a significant determinant of PROP bitterness; heterozygotes showed a flat relationship. Those tasting concentrated PROP as more bitter also tasted concentrated sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride, and quinine as more intense, even after statistically controlling for TAS2R38 genotype, FP, and intensity of tones (nonoral standard). To summarize, although PROP threshold generally exhibited single-gene complete dominance, PROP bitterness may involve additional bitter receptors as evidenced by misclassification of some nontaster homozygotes and the bitterness functions for concentrated PROP. Variability in receptor expression may explain attenuated bitterness–FP relationships. PROP bitterness does associate with heightened taste sensations (i.e., supertasting), but this is not due to TAS2R38 polymorphisms.","author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"John E."},{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Kidd","given":"Judith R."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Valerie B."}],"citation-key":"hayes_supertasting_2008","container-title":"Chemical Senses","DOI":"10.1093/chemse/bjm084","ISSN":"0379-864X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"255-265","title":"Supertasting and PROP Bitterness Depends on More Than the TAS2R38 Gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjm084","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"haynie_wanderworter_2014","abstract":"Wanderwörter are a problematic set of words in historical linguistics. They usually make up a small proportion of the total vocabulary of individual languages, and only a minority of loanwords. They are, however, found frequently in languages from across the world. There is, to our knowledge, no general synthesis of Wanderwörter patterns, causes of exceptionally high borrowing rates for particular lexical items, or estimates of their frequency across language families. Claims about the causes of their spread exist, but have not been widely tested. Nor, despite researchers’ intuitions that Wanderwörter form a distinct type of borrowing, is there a clear demonstration that Wanderwörter are, in fact, different from other loanwords in any concrete way. In the present paper, we examine the phenomenon of Wanderwörter using a standard sample of vocabulary in languages of Australia, North America and South America. The investigation presented here examines Wanderwörter in great enough detail to answer questions about the linguistic and social processes by which Wanderwörter migrate as well as the shapes and densities of the resulting networks. We show that Wanderwörter can be categorically distinguished from other borrowing. The study of Wanderwörter to date has focused on agricultural or industrialized societies; however, the phenomenon is well attested in networks of smaller languages. There are areal differences in types of Wanderwörter and the networks through which they spread. Specific categories of cultural association, including but not limited to agricultural cultivation, condition widespread borrowing. Wanderwörter are outliers in the realm of loanwords, borrowed far more frequently than typical lexical items but still a subset of a more general phenomenon. We show that the link between Wanderwörter and cultural diffusion may be a more sound basis for defining this term than the traditional definitions that invoke the loan frequency, areality, or untraceability of these terms.","author":[{"family":"Haynie","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Bowern","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Epps","given":"Patience"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jane"},{"family":"McConvell","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"haynie_wanderworter_2014","container-title":"Ampersand","container-title-short":"Ampersand","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amper.2014.10.001","ISSN":"2215-0390","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","title":"Wanderwörter in languages of the Americas and Australia","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215039014000022","volume":"1"},

It highlights the region’s “sea people”, giving special attention to their complex and dynamic interactions with terrestrial communities. Their cultures and aquatic lifestyles, it is argued, are relevant to understanding the wider context of various historical and contemporary issues in this region. Since the emergence of large-scale harbour polities in Sumatra, Borneo and other parts of insular Southeast Asia, nomadic maritime communities have intermittently appropriated the roles of prote´ge´s, outlaws and victims in a multilayered and multifaceted interplay of seaborne navigation, commerce and warfare. On the one hand, many of the interethnic power relations that helped shape the maritime history of Southeast Asia have remained intact to date and can help us understand a number of present-day phenomena. On the other, 19th and 20th-century developments have largely conﬁned these communities to the margins of society, while their erstwhile “maritory” has become the battleground of competing “globalised” crime syndicates, maritime terrorists and post-independent nation states with modern navies.

These authors incorporated ideas from South East Asia as well as China and Europe in their works, providing insights in traditional notions of heteronormative manhood, but also exposing major reconfigurations of gender within the diverse conditions of modernity. Their writings thus provide an underexplored vista into a remarkably diverse society in transition. I will centre on words used in the Malay vernacular to characterize men and male behaviour. This serves as a springboard to explore three interconnected themes surrounding manliness in Sino-Malay publications: violence, sexuality, and modernity. As will be shown, several constructions of gender and manifestations of popular culture associated with modern Indonesia were rooted in the same discourse as these colonial-era works.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_manliness_2016","container-title":"South East Asia Research","container-title-short":"South East Asia Research","DOI":"10.1177/0967828X16649313","ISSN":"0967-828X, 2043-6874","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"283-307","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Manliness in Sino-Malay publications in the Netherlands Indies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1177/0967828X16649313","volume":"24"},

We call attention to three diﬀerent types of cooks documented in the island’s textual record: household cooks (including commercial cooks), cooks in religious establishments, and professional cooks. Women were in charge of the ﬁrst category, whereas the second and third were controlled by men yet also featured women. Household cooks and religious cooks mainly prepared simple fare, whereas chefs employed by courts were responsible for the repast of the elites. To learn more about these cooks and their skills, we examine speciﬁc passages of Old Javanese texts, which should not be neglected by food historians of Southeast Asia. These excerpts are analyzed in comparison with contemporaneous texts from India and Cambodia.

  {"id":"hoogervorst_sailors_2018","abstract":"A renewed interested in Indian Ocean studies has underlined possibilities of the transnational. This study highlights lexical borrowing as an analytical tool to deepen our understanding of cultural exchanges between Indian Ocean ports during the long nineteenth century, comparing loanwords from several Asian and African languages and demonstrating how doing so can re-establish severed links between communities. In this comparative analysis, four research avenues come to the fore as speciﬁcally useful to explore the dynamics of non-elite contact in this part of the world: (1) nautical jargon, (2) textile terms, (3) culinary terms, and (4) slang associated with society’s lower strata. These domains give prominence to a spectrum of cultural brokers frequently overlooked in the wider literature. It is demonstrated through concrete examples that an analysis of lexical borrowing can add depth and substance to existing scholarship on interethnic contact in the Indian Ocean, providing methodological inspiration to examine lesser studied connections. This study reveals no uniﬁed linguistic landscape, but several key individual connections between the ports of the Indian Ocean frequented by Persian, Hindustani, and Malay-speaking communities.","author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_sailors_2018","container-title":"Itinerario","container-title-short":"Itinerario","DOI":"10.1017/S0165115318000645","ISSN":"0165-1153","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"516-548","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sailors, Tailors, Cooks, and Crooks: On Loanwords and Neglected Lives in Indian Ocean Ports","title-short":"Sailors, Tailors, Cooks, and Crooks","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0165115318000645/type/journal_article","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"hoogervorst_screaming_2021","abstract":"An insensitive poem published in 1935 sparked a wave of outrage among the Indies Chinese students in the Netherlands. Titled The yellow peril, it had started as an inside joke among Leiden’s Indologists, yet quickly aroused the fury of both moderates and radicals. Their anti-colonial activism flared up for months, attracting numerous allies and eventually taking hold in the Netherlands Indies. After the Indologists had apologized, the number of activists willing to push for more structural change dwindled. As such, this microhistory lays bare some broader dynamics of anti-racism. We argue that ethnic Chinese, who continue to be portrayed as an unobtrusive model minority, have a longer legacy of activism than they are usually given credit for. This is particularly relevant in the present, when Covid-induced Sinophobia, anti-Black racism, and a reassessment of the colonial past are inspiring new movements and forging new antiracist solidarities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Tarisa","given":"Melita"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_screaming_2021","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"Bijdr. taal-, land- volkenkd.","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-bja10020","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"27-61","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘The Screaming Injustice of Colonial Relationships’: Tracing Chinese Anti-racist Activism in the Netherlands","title-short":"‘The Screaming Injustice of Colonial Relationships’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bki/177/1/article-p27_2.xml","volume":"177"},

  {"id":"hoogervorst_urban_2017","abstract":"This study investigates Java’s urban middle classes and their importance in the formation of ‘modern’ lifestyles in Indonesia. They formed the backbone of both the Dutch colonial project and the resultant Indonesian nation-state. By foregrounding lifestyle as the defining factor of middle-class identity, we demonstrate how language and images provide a methodological framework to reconstruct this group’s ambitions and aspirations. Their language, an urban variety of Malay, was key to accessing and, in fact, creating discourses of modernity. This transformation was accelerated by the ‘visual turn’ in the late-colonial Netherlands Indies—and, indeed, globally. Advertisements and other visual messages, typically through the medium of the Malay language, promoted new ways to dress, work, travel, and consume. Yet Java’s middle classes were by no means uncritical recipients of these colonial and global novelties. A counterdiscourse soon emerged, which questioned the consequences of being modern and the dangers of losing traditional values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Schulte Nordholt","given":"Henk"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_urban_2017","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-17304002","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"442-474","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urban Middle Classes in Colonial Java (1900–1942): Images and Language","title-short":"Urban Middle Classes in Colonial Java (1900–1942)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/abstract/journals/bki/173/4/article-p442_2.xml","volume":"173"},
  {"id":"hoogervorst_what_2017","abstract":"Did the Chinese in late colonial Java have their own variety of Malay? The books, newspapers and periodicals issued by Chinese-owned publishing houses indeed feature an idiosyncratic linguistic style. It is less clear how this variety differed from the Malay of other ethnic groups. This has led to the belief that ‘Chinese Malay’ was a purely political concept detached from linguistic reality. Taking issue with this assumption, I call attention to four sociolinguistic phenomena in the Netherlands Indies that have been labelled as ‘Chinese Malay’: (1) mixed languages consisting of elements from local Malay, Javanese and Hokkien; (2) a Chinese-influenced idiom seen in translated books; (3) code-mixing with Hokkien as a deliberate tool to inscribe ethnic difference; and (4) the use of stereotyped Chinese accents for humorous purposes. I approach these phenomena as mutually complementary lenses to investigate the linguistic character of the Chinese-authored Malay publications that shaped the literary landscapes of late colonial Java. Doing so provides novel insights into the society in which they were produced, especially in the under-explored domains of inter-ethnic contact, popular literature, cultural identification, and humour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom G."}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_what_2017","container-title":"Indonesia and the Malay World","container-title-short":"Indonesia and the Malay World","DOI":"10.1080/13639811.2017.1340030","ISSN":"1363-9811, 1469-8382","issue":"133","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"294-314","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What kind of language was ‘Chinese Malay’ in late colonial Java?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13639811.2017.1340030","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"huang_sinica_2003","abstract":"The sinica BOW (academia sinica bilingual ontological WordNet) is intended as a linguistic infrastructure for knowledge representation and knowledge engineering. It is built upon the relation-based structure of WordNet. On one hand, a bilingual WordNet is constructed with the crucial design feature of treating bilingual translation correspondences as lexical semantic relations. On the other hand, SUMO (suggested upper merged ontology) is adopted as the shared system of conceptual categorization. SUMO is also one of the first conceptual categorization systems to be mapped to an English lexicon. By the combination of ontology and WordNet, we hope that sinica BOW will 1) give each linguistic form a rigorous conceptual location, 2) clarify the relation between conceptual classification and linguistic instantiation, and 3) facilitate genuine cross-lingual access of knowledge. In addition to the integration of WordNet and ontology, it is also an important goal of sinica BOW to integrate lexical resources such that the linguistic-to-conceptual representation and language -to- language gaps can be bridged simultaneously. Taking lexicon as a bridging knowledgebase and ontology as the overall knowledge structure seems to be a logical choice. Integrating the two resources with multilingual capacity will add to the versatility and open new possibilities.","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"huang_sinica_2003","container-title":"International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/NLPKE.2003.1276018","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"825-826","title":"Sinica BOW: integrating bilingual WordNet and SUMO ontology","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"huang_sinica_2010","abstract":"The Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological Wordnet (Sinica BOW) integrates three resources: WordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Database (ECTED), and SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology). The three resources were originally linked in two pairs: WordNet 1.6 was manually mapped to SUMO (Niles & Pease 2003) and also to ECTED (the English lemmas in WordNet were mapped to their Chinese lexical equivalents). ECTED encodes both equivalent pairs and their semantic relations (Huang et al. 2003). With the integration of these three key resources, Sinica BOW functions both as an English-Chinese bilingual wordnet and a bilingual lexical access to SUMO. Sinica BOW allows versatile access and facilitates a combination of lexical, semantic, and ontological information. Versatility is built in with its bilinguality, and the lemma-based merging of multiple resources. First, either English or Chinese can be used for the query, as well as for presenting the content of the resources. Second, the user can easily access the logical structure of both the WordNet and SUMO ontology using either words or conceptual nodes. Third, multiple linguistic indexing is built in to allow additional versatility. Fourth, domain information allows another dimension of knowledge manipulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Ru-Yng"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hsiang-bin"}],"citation-key":"huang_sinica_2010","container-title":"Ontology and the Lexicon","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511676536.012","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-ren"},{"family":"Calzolari","given":"Nicoletta"},{"family":"Gangemi","given":"Aldo"},{"family":"Lenci","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Oltramari","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Prevot","given":"Laurent"}],"ISBN":"978-0-521-88659-8 978-0-511-67653-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"201-211","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sinica BOW (Bilingual Ontological WordNet): integration of bilingual WordNet and SUMO","title-short":"Sinica BOW (Bilingual Ontological WordNet)","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511676536A087/type/book_part"},

  {"id":"ibnsina_alqanun_1329","abstract":"Avicenna, 980-1037 Author. \nAbu ʻAli al-Husayn Ibn Sina was born in Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan) in 980 and died in Hamadan (present-day Iran) in 1037. One of the intellectual luminaries of the medieval world, known in the Latin West as Avicenna, this Persian polymath was often referred to by Muslim authors as al-Shaykh al-Raʼīs (the preeminent scholar), acknowledgment of his status as one of the foremost savants of the Islamic world. A prolific author, Ibn Sina wrote on topics as varied as metaphysics, theology, medicine, psychology, earth sciences, physics, astronomy, astrology, and chemistry. Ibn Sina's fame in Europe rests principally on this work, al-Qānūn fī al-ṭibb (The canon of medicine), which was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century and remained part of the standard curriculum for medical students until the late 17th century. It was due to the reputation of this work, as well as two of Ibn Sina's other works that were translated into Latin-al-Adwiya al-qalbīya (Cardiac medication) and al-Urjūza fī al-ṭibb (a versified manual on medicine)-that Ibn Sina was sometimes referred to in the Latin West as princeps medicorum (prince of physicians). The Canon of Medicine is organized into five books as follows: Book 1 is entitled al-Umūr al-kulliya fī 'ilm al-ṭibb (General medical principles) and covers the basic principles of medicine; Book 2 is entitled al-Adwiya al-mufrada (Materia medica) and lists approximately 800 individual drugs of vegetable and mineral origin; Book 3 is entitled al-Amrāḍ al-juz'iya (Special pathology) and discusses the diseases of individual organs; Book 4 is entitled al-Amrāḍ allatī lā takhtaṣṣ bi 'udw bi 'aynihi (Diseases involving more than one member) and discusses medical conditions that affect the entire body, such as fevers and poisons; Book 5 is entitled al-Adwiya al-murakkaba wa al-aqrābādhīn (Formulary) and lists some 650 medicinal compounds as well as their uses and effects. The present manuscript includes Book 1. Also present are fragments from Book 2, which appears to have sustained heavy water damage. Some of the preserved details in this part of the work include the beautiful illuminated title panel marking the beginning of the second book, which appears on page 298. There are occasional marginal additions, corrections, and glosses. The text is in black naskh script, with headings in red. The manuscript was completed in 729 AH (1329).\n\n    -  Title devised, in English, by Library staff. \n    -  Original resource extent: 314 folios ; 250 x 195 millimeters. \n    -  Reference extracted from World Digital Library: A.Z.

Widely attested in literary records and known from Old Javanese inscriptions, the function and social status of\n              taṇḍa\n              has been a controversial issue. Two views pertaining to the identity of these men have been advanced so far.

  {"id":"jakl_folding_2016","abstract":"This essay analyses in detail Old Javanese term ləpihan. Typically, scholars of Javanese literature suppose that ləpihan denotes predominantly, if not exclusively, processed palm leaves, used for letters, messages, and books. A close reading of Old and Middle Javanese texts, however, suggests that the description of ləpihan is not consistent with the physical properties of the palm-leaf book. The essay offers an alternative hypothesis that Old Javanese ləpihan denoted folding books, blank note-books, and documents such as letters made from processed “bark paper,” a material well-known and used in pre-Islamic Java. This format was also known in the pre-Islamic period in Sumatra, as testified by the so-called Tanjung Tanah manuscript, a Malay “bark paper” folding book, dated to the late 14th or early 15th century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jakl","given":"Jiri"}],"citation-key":"jakl_folding_2016","container-title":"Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient","container-title-short":"befeo","DOI":"10.3406/befeo.2016.6234","ISSN":"0336-1519","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"165-193","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Folding Book Format (Concertina) in Pre-Islamic Java: Revisiting the Old Javanese Term ləpihan","title-short":"The Folding Book Format (Concertina) in Pre-Islamic Java","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_2016_num_102_1_6234","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"jakl_iiterary_2016","abstract":"The contribution analyses the literary motif of acquiring trophy heads in the context of warfare practices depicted in kakavin, court poems composed in a literary register of Old Javanese. In the ﬁrst part, two terms of unclear meaning, cәṅәl and varagaṅ, are discussed in detail. It is argued that Old Javanese cәṅәl denotes ‘trophy head’, a severed head rendered as a token of martial prowess. Evidence of the Navanatya, an Old Javanese account of court etiquette composed in the 14th century, is used to support my claim that ﬁctive kakavin do reﬂect the practice of head-taking as part of Javanese pre-Islamic warfare culture. It is demonstrated that the status of head-taking in kakavin is ambiguous. Though typically ascribed to the characters of adharma, the king, a protector of dharma, is represented in a couple of texts as a receiver of trophy heads. In the second and third parts of this article the category of combatants called varagaṅ, associated in Old Javanese texts with predatory warfare and with adharma, is analysed. Fighting as individuals in a loosely dispersed swarm, the main objective of the strategy of varagaṅ was to harass enemy settlements, take captives, and spread terror. It is argued that the category of varagaṅ represented young men who had to prove themselves in battle and whose major objective was to display martial prowess in front of other warriors in one-toone skirmishing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"jakl_iiterary_2016","container-title":"Indonesia and the Malay World","container-title-short":"Indonesia and the Malay World","DOI":"10.1080/13639811.2015.1133140","ISSN":"1363-9811, 1469-8382","issue":"129","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,3]]},"language":"en","page":"165-187","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Iiterary motif of head-taking in Old Javanese court poems ( <i>kakavin</i> ): cěṅěl and varagaṅ terms revisited","title-short":"The Iiterary motif of head-taking in Old Javanese court poems ( <i>kakavin</i> )","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13639811.2015.1133140","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"jakl_literary_","abstract":"Literary representations of the coconut palm in Old Javanese court poetry are analyzed. First, pronounced erotic symbolism of nuts, pervasive in poems, is discussed. In what is clearly a literary cliche, nuts, especially a variety called in the texts “dwarf/ivory nuts” are likened to a woman’s breasts. Second, the coconut palm is represented as a plant element typical of the seashore environment, its natural habitat, as well as of remote, oten small, villages in the Javanese interior. It is argued that this image relects the fact that the coconut palm, propagated sexually, cannot travel inland without the human agency, and that harvesting of the coconut palms may have been an important, if not dominant, element of remote inland settlements that relied on the palm economy rather than on rice cultivation. It gives us an interesting glimpse into in “imagined” ancient Java, where palm economy may have represented a backbone of local economy. hird, this digniied status of the coconut palm, all but forgotten now, is further emphasized in a couple of literary images where the palm is represented as one of the divine, “celestial” trees, growing in heavenly gardens.","author":[{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"jakl_literary_","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Literary representations of the coconut palm in Old Javanese kakavin poetry","type":"article-journal"},

It is argued that a combination of biological and cultural inhibitions resulted in the fact that the sugar palm in Old Javanese literature is never represented as growing at the precincts of hermitages and other religious establishments. Next, the role of the symbolism of the sugar palm in the pre-modern concept of bravery is explored.

This result indicates the possibility that BERT networks capture structural information about language. In this work, we provide novel support for this claim by performing a series of experiments to unpack the elements of English language structure learned by BERT. We ﬁrst show that BERT’s phrasal representation captures phrase-level information in the lower layers. We also show that BERT’s intermediate layers encode a rich hierarchy of linguistic information, with surface features at the bottom, syntactic features in the middle and semantic features at the top. BERT turns out to require deeper layers when long-distance dependency information is required, e.g. to track subjectverb agreement. Finally, we show that BERT representations capture linguistic information in a compositional way that mimics classical, tree-like structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Jawahar","given":"Ganesh"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Seddah","given":"Djamé"}],"citation-key":"jawahar_what_2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.18653/v1/P19-1356","event-place":"Florence, Italy","event-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"3651-3657","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Florence, Italy","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What Does BERT Learn about the Structure of Language?","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1356"},

  {"id":"jurafsky_language_2014","abstract":"In The Language of Food, Stanford University professor and MacArthur Fellow Dan Jurafsky peels away the mysteries from the foods we think we know. Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like \"rich\" and \"crispy,\" zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a bag of potato chips. The fascinating journey through The Language of Food uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight, words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of culinary exchange - a sharing of ideas and culture as much as ingredients and flavors - lies just beneath the surface of our daily snacks, soups, and suppers.","author":[{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"jurafsky_language_2014","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"0-393-24083-5 978-0-393-24083-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher":"W.W.

  {"id":"kaplan_adriatic_2022","abstract":"\"In this insightful travelogue, geopolitical expert Robert Kaplan turns his perceptive eye to the Adriatic Sea, a region that has always been a crossroads in trade, culture, and ideas. Kaplan undertakes a journey through Italy and the Balkan countries lining the Adriatic to reveal much more to the region than news stories about resurgent populism or the refugee crisis let on. As he travels, the stark truth emerges that the age of populism is merely an epiphenomenon--a swan song for the age of nationalism itself--and that the future of Europe lies in a different direction entirely as he observes a breaking down of the distinctions between east and west, a return to alignments of an earlier era. Traveling the coastline from Italy to Slovenia and Croatia, to Montenegro to Albania and to Greece, he engages perceptive cultural criticism and an urgent study of Europe as a whole, seen through the lens of these countries. He finds clues to what the future may hold in history as he reflects on contemporary issues like the refugee crisis, the return of populist nationalism, battles over the control of fossil fuel resources, and how the Adriatic will once again be a global trading hub as it is set to be connected to China's Belt and Road initiative. With a cross-pollination of history, literature, art, architecture, and current events along with a map and photographs throughout, Kaplan demonstrates how Europe is distilled within the geography of the Adriatic, an often-overlooked region rich with answers and insights about the fate of the continent\"--","author":[{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Robert D."}],"call-number":"D971","citation-key":"kaplan_adriatic_2022","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-399-59106-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Adriatic: a concert of civilizations at the end of the modern age","title-short":"Adriatic","type":"book"},

As such, the Arabists exerted considerable influence both as career diplomats and as bureaucrats within the State Department from the early nineteenth century to the present. But over time, as this work shows, the group increasingly lost touch with a rapidly changing American society, growing both more insular and headstrong and showing a marked tendency to assert the Arab point of view. Drawing on interviews, memoirs, and other official and private sources, Kaplan reconstructs the 100-year history of the Arabist elite, demonstrating their profound influence on American attitudes toward the Middle East, and tracing their decline as an influx of ethnic and regional specialists has transformed the State Department and challenged the power of the old elite","author":[{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"kaplan_arabists_2014","event-place":"Place of publication not identified","ISBN":"978-1-4391-0870-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 893117007","publisher":"Free Press","publisher-place":"Place of publication not identified","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Arabists: the romance of an american elite","title-short":"Arabists","type":"book"},

  {"id":"karrer_capsaicin_1991","abstract":"The desensitization resulting from application of 10 or 100 ppm capsaicin was investigated, using daily testing of a capsaicin series (1–1000 ppm, in log steps). The series showed a significant decrement in perceived burn following desensitization with either concentration. Perceived burn of 100 and 1000 ppm did not recover from 100 ppm desensitization in six days, and perceived burn of 1–1000 ppm did not recover from 10 ppm desensitization in six days. When single capsaicin concentrations, rather than the series, were tested at one, two, four, or six days after desensitization, 10 ppm recovered from 10 ppm desensitization in one or two days, and 100 ppm recovered from 100 ppm desensitization between two and four days. This suggests that daily testing with the capsaicin series delayed recovery from desensitization. Nontasters of 6-n-propylthiouracil rated capsaicin burn lower than did tasters. The application method of rolling capsaicin onto the tongue with a swab was found to transiently inhibit brrn. Implications for ingesting capsaicin products are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Karrer","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."}],"citation-key":"karrer_capsaicin_1991","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/0031-9384(91)90315-F","ISSN":"0031-9384","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"page":"757-764","title":"Capsaicin Desensitization and Recovery on the Human Tongue","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849190315F","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"kartika_spice_","abstract":"Long ago, before colonial period, Jakarta was known as Bandar City. The Sunda Kelapa port became a trading center as well as economic center in the archipelago. Many traders from Java, Bugis, Malay, Arab, European, and Chinese came to trade to Bandar City through the Sunda Kelapa Harbor. Spices became one of the trading commodities at that time apart from cloth, porcelain, coffee, perfumes, pepper, gold, fruits, and so on. Batavian cuisine at that time was already formed and the got the influence of cultural acculturation that occurred between the Batavians and other ethnic groups in Bandar City or Batavia. The influence of foreign ethnic groups affected the ingredient and cooking techniques of Batavian culinary treasures. These can be called as spice routes from other ethnic groups to the Batavian culinary trail. Therefore, Batavia is as a native of Jakarta, has a rich and diverse culture, especially in the field of culinary gastronomy, has inherited many cultural values and local wisdom in every typical Batavian culinary menu. Gastronomy and culture have a very close relationship, so that every Batavia cuisine and food has its own philosophy that grows and develops in aspects of life. The relationship between culture and gastronomy arises because of the results of cultivation in the agricultural sector so that the embodiment of color, aroma and taste of a food can be traced to its origin from the environment where the raw material is produced. This review collects the information and data through observation, in depth interview, and literature study. Interview conducted to the informants who were Batavia historians and elders, cooks and native Batavian who were scattered in the neighbourhood area of Ampera Raya, and Sawangan. In addition, information and data were collected through literature studies and analyzed the culture or philosophy contained in typical Batavia foods or traditional foods. There are 4 stages in this, namely the historical, cultural, geographic, and cooking stages. All of them are closely related to the background of a philosophy that plays a role in the life of the native Batavian which forms the identity of a region as a distinctive value or cultural characteristic. These two things must be maintained by the future generations of the Batavian, so that the values of local wisdom can continue to be preserved and carried out by the indigenous Batavian themselves in Jakarta land..","author":[{"family":"Kartika","given":"Dwi Indah"},{"family":"Kartika","given":"Yunita"}],"citation-key":"kartika_spice_","container-title":"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research","page":"722-733","title":"The Spice Route from Arabic, Europe and China to Jayakarta toward Batavian Cuisine: Revitalization of Batavian Local Wisdom Values through Batavian Culinary Gastronomy","type":"article-journal","volume":"660"},

  {"id":"kaufman_history_2007","abstract":"The word *kakaw(a) (‘cacao’, Theobroma cacao) was widely diffused among Mesoamerican languages, and from there to much of lower Central America. This study provides evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that this word originated in the Mije-Sokean family; that it spread from the Mije-Sokean languages in or around the Olmec heartland into southeastern Mesoamerican languages; that its diffusion into Mayan languages took place between about 200 B.C. and A.D. 400; and that it spread from a Mije-Sokean language in or near the Basin of Mexico into languages in the region. It shows that each of the arguments presented by Dakin and Wichmann (2000) against a Mije-Sokean origin is either unworkable, is based upon false premises, or is not relevant; and that their proposed alternative – that it originated in and spread from Nawa into other Mesoamerican languages – conﬂicts with the mass of evidence relevant to the issue. This study also discusses the linguistic details of vocabulary for drinks made from cacao; shows that no proposed etymology for the word chocolate is correct, but agrees with Dakin and Wichmann that its proximate source is a Nawa form chikola:tl; and discusses the history of words for Theobroma bicolor (‘Nicaragua chocolate tree; pataxte’) and their use. The linguistic data are pertinent to issues of intergroup interaction in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, but do not shed light on the nature or the cultural context of the diffusion of cacao in Mesoamerica, nor on its uses.","author":[{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Terrence"},{"family":"Justeson","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"kaufman_history_2007","container-title":"Ancient Mesoamerica","container-title-short":"Ancient Mesoam","DOI":"10.1017/s0956536107000211","ISSN":"0956-5361","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"193-237","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The History of the Word for Cacao in Ancient Mesoamerica","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0956536107000211/type/journal_article","volume":"18"},

Multiple data sources indicate that civil conflict increased significantly and generalized linear modeling correlates strife in the city with drought conditions between 1400 and 1450 cal. CE.

This book examines the lives of such words in today's discourse on eating and drinking, focusing on foreign - particularly East Asian - influences on culinary terms in English, and how words are born and evolve in a modern transcultural environment. Through the lens of culinary words, this book demonstrates that foreign-origin and hybrid words, previously considered marginal, have become a main source of new imports into our daily lexicon. With case studies from Japan to Mongolia, Hong Kong to Korea, China to Vietnam, and beyond, this book examines how more and more words are becoming borderless and forming their own new global identities. By showcasing some lesser-known regional cuisines, alongside staple dishes that many of us already know and love, this book offers a wide range of examples in order to illustrate the metamorphosis of the manner in which we engage with food words.

The arrival of these new materia medica is commonly accepted to be a consequence of the expanding horizons of trade in the Islamic period.

In addition, the philological evidence of the names of these materia medica in Arabic frequently shows that their path into the Near East occurred through Persian culture.

  {"id":"koczy_nature_2018","abstract":"This book analyses the emotional message of Hungarian folksongs from a Cultural Linguistic perspective, employing a wide range of empirical devices. It combines theoretical notions with analytical devices and has a multidisciplinary essence: it relies on the latest Cultural Linguistic findings, employing spatial semantics, cognitive linguistics, cognitive psychology and ethnography. The book addresses key questions including: How is nature conceptualized by a folk cultural group? How are emotions and other mental states expressed via nature imagery with respect to metaphors and construal schemas? The author argues that folksongs reflect the Hungarian peasant communities' specific treatment of emotions, captured in an underlying cultural schema 'reservedness.' This schema is grounded in principals of morality and tradition, and governs the various levels of representation. The main topics discussed are related to two core issues: cultural metaphors and cultural sche mas of construal in folksongs. It provides a detailed example, based on over 1000 folksongs, of how a cultural group's cognition can be analyzed and better understood through a representative corpus-based linguistic approach. The research is also pioneering in constructing a comprehensive analysis framework adapted to folk poetry, and offers an example of how cultural conceptualizations can be investigated in various discourse types. Last but not least, the book offers insights into the work of Hungarian linguists and folklorists concerning cultural conceptualizations, which have largely been unavailable in English","author":[{"family":"Kóczy","given":"Judit Baranyiné"}],"call-number":"410","citation-key":"koczy_nature_2018","collection-title":"Cultural Linguistics","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-5753-3","edition":"1st ed. 2018","event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-10-5753-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Springer Singapore : Imprint: Springer","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Nature, Metaphor, Culture: Cultural Conceptualizations in Hungarian Folksongs","title-short":"Nature, Metaphor, Culture","type":"book"},
  {"id":"koehler_koehler_1887","abstract":"Hermann A. Köhler's magnum opus, Medizinal Pflanzen, was published in parts since 1883. The first volume was finished in 1887, eight years after his death. The set of three volumes was a noteworthy achievement and included plants of medicinal interest from several European nations. Köhler's Medizinal Pflanzen was edited by Gustav Pabst, M.A.T.E. Vogtherr, R.L.A.M. Gürke and F. Elsner. A supplement was added in 1913-'14 by G. Schellenberg and W. Brandt The remarkable feature of the publication is its nearly 300 finely detailed illustrations, expertly drawn by the artists Walther Otto Müller and C.F.

Apart from alphanumerical meteorological information, the database contains nautical information relevant to historians, and provides access to a considerable number of images of logbook pages. The construction of the database involved a number of difﬁculties, including language, unit conversion, terminology and zero meridian problems.

  {"id":"kovacs_war_2022","abstract":"This dispatch outlines some of the immediate consequences and long-term challenges posed by the Ukraine war on food security and production systems in Eastern Europe. We draw particular attention to the food aid and provisioning realities around many million (and increasing) numbers of Ukrainian refugees, and the current lack of systemic, government-coordinated responses to the humanitarian crisis. Further, we outline the distinct forms of agriculture characterizing Eastern Europe, notably, the short supply chains and farming networks that are socially and environmentally unique and valuable, and are a result of the persistence of smaller, family-led farms. However, these farms and farmers are facing increasingly difficult times as a result of inflation, rising fuel prices, rationing, climate stress, export bans, and now large numbers of refugees arriving to some already very poor rural areas. We highlight the need for these multiple stresses to be discussed together, for their consequences on food production in the short and long term, especially as the effects of the war extend beyond the region. These stresses include, in the immediate, a lack (and a lack of reliability on) of state aid and infrastructures for refugee hosts and food aid organizations and, in the longer term, persisting EU-policy and market pushes toward intensification that will greatly challenge the smallholder system in Eastern Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kovács","given":"Eszter Krasznai"},{"family":"Bachórz","given":"Agata"},{"family":"Bunzl","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Mincyte","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Parasecoli","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Piras","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Mihai"}],"citation-key":"kovacs_war_2022","container-title":"Gastronomica","DOI":"10.1525/gfc.2022.22.3.1","ISSN":"1529-3262, 1533-8622","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The War in Ukraine and Food Security in Eastern Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article/22/3/1/192112/The-War-in-Ukraine-and-Food-Security-in-Eastern","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"kumar_state_2008","abstract":"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is the most expensive spice of the world, and it is one of the 85 members of the genus Crocus. It is native of Asia Minor, and it is cultivated in Mediterranean countries. Saffron predominantly contains certain chemical constituents that are responsible for imparting colour, flavour, and aroma. Some of its components have cytotoxic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor properties. Since, saffron is a triploid (2n = 3x = 24) plant and fails to produce seed upon selfing or crossing, so it is propagated through corms. The growing area for saffron is not extensive, although its demand in the international market is increasing. Research activities have been initiated to develop new production technologies of this spice in many countries. Saffron grows best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay calcareous soils. Besides, climate and soil, planting time, seed/corm rate, planting depth, corm size/weight, crop density, nutrient management, weed management, growth regulators, harvest, and post-harvest management also influence saffron quality and quantity. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compile the recent agronomic research on saffron for commercial flower and corm production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Rakesh"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Virendra"},{"family":"Devi","given":"Kiran"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Madhu"},{"family":"Singh","given":"M.K."},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"P.S."}],"citation-key":"kumar_state_2008","container-title":"Food Reviews International","container-title-short":"Food Reviews International","DOI":"10.1080/87559120802458503","ISSN":"8755-9129, 1525-6103","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,22]]},"language":"en","page":"44-85","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"State of Art of Saffron (Crocus sativus L.)

  {"id":"kurlansky_choice_2002","abstract":"\"Every once in awhile a writer of particular skills takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight.\" That's how David McCullough described Mark Kurlansky's Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, a work that revealed how a meal can be as important as it is edible. Salt: A World History, its successor, did the same for a seasoning, and confirmed Kurlansky as one of our most erudite and entertaining food authors. Now, the winner of the James Beard Award for Excellence in Food Writing shares a varied selection of \"choice cuts\" by others, as he leads us on a mouthwatering culinary tour around the world and through history and culture from the fifth century B.C. to the present day. Choice Cuts features more than two hundred pieces, from Cato to Cab Calloway. Here are essays by Plato on the art of cooking ... Pablo Neruda on french fries ... Alice B. Toklas on killing a carp ... M.F.K. Fisher on the virility of Turkish desserts ... Alexandre Dumas on coffee ... W.H. Auden on Icelandic food ... Elizabeth David on the downward march of English pizza ... Claude LEvi-Strauss on \"the idea of rotten\" ... James Beard on scrambled eggs ... Balzac, Virginia Woolf, E.M.

  {"id":"lanefox_invention_2020","abstract":"Medicine is one of the great fields of achievement of the Ancient Greeks. Hippocrates is celebrated worldwide as the father of medicine and the Hippocratic Oath is admired throughout the medical profession as a founding statement of ethics and ideals. In the fifth century BC, Greeks even wrote of medicine as a newly discovered craft they had invented. Robin Lane Fox's remarkable book puts their invention of medicine in a wider context, from the epic poems of Homer to the first doctors known to have been active in the Greek world. He examines what we do and do not know about Hippocrates and his Oath and the many writings that survive under his name. He then focuses on seven core texts which give the case histories of named individuals, showing that books 1 and 3 belong far earlier than previously recognised. Their re-dating has important consequences for the medical awareness of the great Greek dramatists and the historians Herodotus and Thucydides. Robin Lane Fox pieces together the doctor's thinking from his terse observations and relates it in a new way to the history of Greek prose and ideas. This original and compelling book opens windows onto many other aspects of the classical world, from women's medicine to street-life, empire, art, sport, sex and even botany. It fills a dark decade in a new way and carries readers along an extraordinary journey form Homer's epics to the grateful heirs of the Greek case histories, first in the Islamic world and then in early modern Europe","author":[{"family":"Lane Fox","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"lanefox_invention_2020","event-place":"[London] UK","ISBN":"978-0-241-27705-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1180181022","publisher":"Allen Lane, an imprint of Penguin Books","publisher-place":"[London] UK","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The invention of medicine: from Homer to Hippocrates","title-short":"The invention of medicine","type":"book"},

  {"id":"lang_digital_2020","abstract":"Many research methods emphasize procedures to minimize potential bias introduced by measurement tools, environmental factors, and researchers themselves. Using the example of digital storytelling, in which short films are cocreated between a researcher and participant, we examine the possibility of cocreated stories as data in philosophical hermeneutic (PH) health research. The etymological explication of the words “data” and “story” brings the meaning of these words closer together while an exploration of the ontological and epistemological assumptions of PH indicate that cocreated digital stories can be viewed as data in a similar way to traditional verbatim interview transcripts used in other types of qualitative health research. Using digital storytelling as a data generation tool in PH health research may help provide a deeper understanding of health-related phenomena by cultivating understanding through genuine conversation, addressing the challenges of language, and apprehending the immediacy of understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lang","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Laing","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Ewashen","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Moules","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"lang_digital_2020","container-title":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","container-title-short":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1609406920913673","ISSN":"1609-4069, 1609-4069","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"160940692091367","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital Stories as Data: An Etymological and Philosophical Exploration of Cocreated Data in Philosophical Hermeneutic Health Research","title-short":"Digital Stories as Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1609406920913673","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"laszlo_narrative_2013","abstract":"Scientific Narrative Psychology integrates quantitative methodologies into the study of identity. Its methodology, Narrative Categorical Analysis, and its toolkit, NarrCat, were both originally developed by the Hungarian Narrative Psychology Group. NarrCat is for machine-made transformation of sentences in self-narratives into psychologically relevant, statistically processable narrative categories. The main body of this flexible and comprehensive system is formed by Psycho-Thematic modules, such as Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality. The Relational Modules include Social References, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and Negation. Certain elements can be combined into Hypermodules, such as Psychological Perspective and Spatio-Temporal Perspective, which allow for even more complex, higher level exploration of composite psychological processes. Using up-to-date developments of corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP), a unique feature of NarrCat is its capacity of SRL. The structure of NarrCat, as well as the empirical results in group identity research, is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"László","given":"János"},{"family":"Csertő","given":"István"},{"family":"Fülöp","given":"Éva"},{"family":"Ferenczhalmy","given":"Réka"},{"family":"Hargitai","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Lendvai","given":"Piroska"},{"family":"Péley","given":"Bernadette"},{"family":"Pólya","given":"Tibor"},{"family":"Szalai","given":"Katalin"},{"family":"Vincze","given":"Orsolya"},{"family":"Ehmann","given":"Bea"}],"citation-key":"laszlo_narrative_2013","container-title":"SAGE Open","container-title-short":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244013492084","ISSN":"2158-2440, 2158-2440","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"215824401349208","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Narrative Language as an Expression of Individual and Group Identity: The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis","title-short":"Narrative Language as an Expression of Individual and Group Identity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244013492084","volume":"3"},

We hypothesized that bioluminescing fireflies, widely known for their vibrant courtship signals, also advertise their noxiousness to echolocating bats. To test this postulate, we pit naïve big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) against chemically defended fireflies (Photinus pyralis) to examine whether and how these beetles transmit salient warnings to bats. We demonstrate that these nocturnal predators learn to avoid noxious fireflies using either vision or echolocation and that bats learn faster when integrating information from both sensory streams—providing fundamental evidence that multisensory integration increases the efficacy of warning signals in a natural predator-prey system. Our findings add support for a warning signal origin of firefly bioluminescence and suggest that bat predation may have driven evolution of firefly bioluminescence.","author":[{"family":"Leavell","given":"Brian C."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Juliette J."},{"family":"McClure","given":"Christopher J.

  {"id":"lemaguer_incense_2015","abstract":"This paper deals with the incenses that were traded and used in the Islamic world from the seventh to the sixteenth century. Many researches and publications deal with the ancient incense trade, but only a few focus on this trade during the Islamic period. This paper aims to present the results obtained from a multidisciplinary methodology. To identify the main substances used as incense, medieval Arabic sources such as the Kit&#x101;b al-nab&#x101;t written by Al-Asma&#x2bf;&#x12b; and Ab&#x16b; &#x1e24;an&#x12b;fah al-D&#x12b;nawar&#x12b;, or Ibn al-Bay&#x1e6d;&#x101;r's al-J&#x101;mi li-mufrad&#x101;t al-adwiyyah wa-l-aghdhiyyah are of great interest.

Now with a new preface and a new chapter that brings the narrative up to the present, the book describes the evolution of Hungarian politics, culture, economics, and identity since the Magyars first arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 896. Through colorful anecdotes of heroes and traitors, victors and victims, revolutionaries and tyrants, Lendvai chronicles the way progressivism and economic modernization have competed with intolerance and narrow-minded nationalism.

By the end of the 16th century, the number of drugs documented had reached close to 1,900. And by the end of the last century, published records of CMM have reached 12,800 drugs. The recorded traditional information includes toxicities, incompatibilities, cautions, precautions and contraindications. Thus, contrary to a general misconception, toxicity data on Chinese herbs exist and are not meager. If consulted properly before embarking on a study of CMM, it will save researchers much time and efforts and the frustration of not obtaining consistent or expected results.

We report findings in relation to flagging (marking of loanwords as being foreign material in a given language) and show that it is (weakly) predicated by frequency-of-use and by semantic category of the loanword (core loans are flagged more than cultural ones), but not by listedness. Alongside this trend, we note that perceptions of writers using the words vary enormously in regard to which loans are integrated and familiar, matching neither listedness nor frequency-of-use patterns. This indicates that in NZE, loanword use remains strongly tied up with socio-political identity and language ideology, rather than rooted in linguistic factors (such as, bilingualism or filling in lexical gaps). •Flagging is not only merely a linguistic reflex.•Flagging is also a sociolinguistic tool that enables speakers to consciously spread new incoming loanwords.•Flagging allows speakers to refresh the use of previously existing (sometimes already listed) loanwords.•Flagging is mediated by speaker perception and speaker attitude.•It is therefore not necessarily an accurate barometer for the degree of acceptance/integration of a given loanword in a RL.•This is of particular importance to language contact scenarios of asymmetrical lexical movement.","author":[{"family":"Levendis","given":"Katharine"},{"family":"Calude","given":"Andreea"}],"citation-key":"levendis_perception_2019","container-title":"Ampersand (Oxford, UK)","DOI":"10.1016/j.amper.2019.100056","ISSN":"2215-0390","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"100056","title":"Perception and flagging of loanwords – A diachronic case-study of Māori loanwords in New Zealand English","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"li_corpusbased_2019","abstract":"Translated restaurant menus facilitate tourism and consumerism, but menu translation remains a peripheral area of professional translation and translation studies. This has economic consequences, because translations that exclude a dish’s ingredients, cooking methods, or cultural associations may deter consumers. This article analyses translated menus featuring Chinese dishes in order to establish the extent to which intersemiotic, image-based approaches are used to complement written translations; the level of consistency with which ingredients and cooking methods are translated; and the frequency of culturally speciﬁc dish names that are challenging to translate. A corpus-based methodology is used to compare 3,000 Chinese dish names and their translations from China, Taiwan and abroad. The data reveals very limited intersemiotic translation in existing menus, inconsistent translations of ingredients and cooking methods, and a high percentage of dishes with culturally speciﬁc names. However, these are often omitted in translation, or lack supplementary information concerning their ingredients. It is proposed that a multimodal translation approach incorporating Jakobson’s tripartite theory can enhance menu translation. Menus featuring Pinyin as an intralingual translation can engage learners of Chinese who use this method; interlingual explicitation clariﬁes a dish’s ingredients, cooking methods and cultural speciﬁcity; and intersemiotic, image-based translation conveys culinary artistry clearly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Saihong"}],"citation-key":"li_corpusbased_2019","container-title":"Perspectives","container-title-short":"Perspectives","DOI":"10.1080/0907676X.2018.1483408","ISSN":"0907-676X, 1747-6623","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A corpus-based multimodal approach to the translation of restaurant menus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0907676X.2018.1483408","volume":"27"},

We first set the background for comparison through a synchronic study of the collocational patterns and grammatical relations of the two words using Sketch Engine. We show that gambling tends to be associated with negatively perceived activities and strong disapproval, whereas gaming tends to collocate with recreational activities, business, and technology. Using Google Books Ngram Viewer, we focus on the drastic diachronic changes in use of the two words, from competition to co-development. Based on corpora trends, we correlate the rise and fall of the two words and the change in their competition relation to particular socio-historical events: gold rushes, sports betting, the popularity of video games, and the gaming industry boom. The classical competition model of near synonyms remained valid until recent socio-economic events introduced additional and unique meanings for both words. The article thus shows that linguistic variations as collective human behavior changes can be leveraged to evidence other collective human behavior changes.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Longxing"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Vincent Xian"}],"citation-key":"li_lexical_2020","container-title":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244020951272","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"2158244020951272","title":"Lexical Competition and Change: A Corpus-Assisted Investigation of Gambling and Gaming in the Past Centuries","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2158244020951272","volume":"10"},

For example it’s not clear how they achieve compositionality, building sentence meaning from the meanings of words and phrases. In this paper we describe strategies for visualizing compositionality in neural models for NLP, inspired by similar work in computer vision. We ﬁrst plot unit values to visualize compositionality of negation, intensiﬁcation, and concessive clauses, allowing us to see wellknown markedness asymmetries in negation. We then introduce methods for visualizing a unit’s salience, the amount that it contributes to the ﬁnal composed meaning from ﬁrst-order derivatives.

We examine the SpokenBNC, a corpus of around 11.4 million words of British English conversations and identify behavioural differences between speakers that are labelled for gender and age categories. We explore differences in language use and turn-taking dynamics and identify a range of characteristics that set the categories apart. We ﬁnd that female speakers tend to produce more and slightly longer turns, while turns by male speakers feature a higher type-token ratio and a distinct range of minimal particles such as “eh”, “uh” and “em”. Across age groups, we observe, for instance, that swear words and laughter characterize young speakers’ talk, while old speakers tend to produce more truncated words. We then use the observed characteristics to predict gender and age labels of speakers per conversation and per turn as a classiﬁcation task, showing that non-lexical utterances such as minimal particles that are usually left out of dialog data can contribute to setting the categories apart.","author":[{"family":"Liesenfeld","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Yu-Yin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"liesenfeld_predicting_2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 34th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","event-place":"Hanoi, Vietnam","event-title":"PACLIC","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"157–166","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Hanoi, Vietnam","title":"Predicting Gender and Age Categories in English Conversations Using Lexical, Non-Lexical, and Turn-Taking Features","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.paclic-1.19"},

Notably, residues of vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and acetonvanillone were identiﬁed in three of the four juglets examined. These are the major fragrance and ﬂavour components of natural vanilla extract. To date, it has been commonly accepted that vanilla was domesticated in the New World and subsequently spread to other parts of the globe. Our research ﬁrst ruled out all possibility of sample contamination and then conducted a post-organic residue analysis investigation of various species within the plant kingdom from which these principle compounds could have been exploited. The results shed new light on the ﬁrst known exploitation of vanilla in an Old World context, including local uses, the signiﬁcance and employment in mortuary practices, and possible implications for understanding trade networks in the ancient Near East during the second millennium BCE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Linares","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Cradic","given":"Melissa S."},{"family":"Finkelstein","given":"Israel"},{"family":"Lipschits","given":"Oded"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Mario A.S."},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Ronny"},{"family":"Stockhammer","given":"Philipp W."},{"family":"Gadot","given":"Yuval"}],"citation-key":"linares_first_2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.03.034","ISSN":"2352409X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"language":"en","page":"77-84","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"First evidence for vanillin in the old world: Its use as mortuary offering in Middle Bronze Canaan","title-short":"First evidence for vanillin in the old world","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X18307557","volume":"25"},

Christian Europe, in fact, feared the exhilarating effects of new drinks, such as chocolate, coffee and tea. Therefore, these beverages would have been banished, had not doctors and scientists explained that they were good for the body. The scientific debate, which reached its peak in Florence in the 18th century, regarded the therapeutic effectiveness of the various chocolate components: it was necessary to know their properties first, in order to prepare the best cacao concoction for every patient. When Dietetics separated from Medicine, however, chocolate acquired the role of vehicle for easing the administration of bitter medicines, being associated to different health problems. The recent rediscovery of the beneficial use of cacao and chocolate focuses upon its value as supplemental nutrition. Building a bridge to the past may be helpful to detect the areas where the potential health benefits of chocolate are likely to be further explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lippi","given":"Donatella"}],"citation-key":"lippi_chocolate_2013","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu5051573","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,14]]},"language":"en","page":"1573-1584","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chocolate in History: Food, Medicine, Medi-Food","title-short":"Chocolate in History","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/5/5/1573","volume":"5"},

During the last half-century or so dedicated scholars such as Pelliot have devoted their major research efforts to the meticulous consideration of the minutiae involved in the subject; and, more recently, Joseph Needham has contrived both to continue the work of such predecessors and to draw some of the major conclusions that are the fruits of basic research conducted in several disciplines. Probably the full story of these exchanges can never be told; for the evidence is sadly deficient; balanced inferences that rely on information gathered from both East and West are rarely possible; and, maddeningly enough, the political restrictions of the 20th century now prevent the application of the modern techniques of archaeology, geography, and anthropology in areas where they are most likely to be successful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Loewe","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"loewe_spices_1971","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

  {"id":"love_swearing_2021","abstract":"This paper investigates changes in swearing usage in informal speech using large-scale corpus data, comparing the occurrence and social distribution of swear words in two corpora of informal spoken British English: the demographically-sampled part of the Spoken British National Corpus 1994 (BNC1994) and the Spoken British National Corpus 2014 (BNC2014); the compilation of the latter has facilitated large-scale, diachronic analyses of authentic spoken data on a scale which has, until now, not been possible. A form and frequency analysis of a set of 16 ‘pure’ swear word lemma forms is presented. The findings reveal that swearing occurrence is significantly lower in the Spoken BNC2014 but still within a comparable range to previous studies. Furthermore, FUCK is found to overtake BLOODY as the most popular swear word lemma. Finally, the social distribution of swearing across gender and age groups generally supports the findings of previous research: males still swear more than females, and swearing still peaks in the twenties and declines thereafter. However, the distribution of swearing according to socio-economic status is found to be more complex than expected in the 2010s and requires further investigation. This paper also reflects on some of the methodological challenges associated with making comparisons between the two corpora.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Love","given":"Robbie"}],"citation-key":"love_swearing_2021","container-title":"Text & Talk","DOI":"10.1515/text-2020-0051","ISSN":"1860-7330, 1860-7349","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]]},"language":"en","page":"739-762","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Swearing in informal spoken English: 1990s–2010s","title-short":"Swearing in informal spoken English","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/text-2020-0051/html","volume":"41"},

Canonically, T2Rs are located in taste buds of the tongue, where they initiate bitter taste perception. However, accumulating evidence indicates that T2Rs are widely expressed throughout the body and mediate diverse nontasting roles through various specialized mechanisms. It has also become apparent that T2Rs and their polymorphisms are associated with human disorders. In this review, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological roles that extraoral T2Rs play in processes as diverse as innate immunity and reproduction, and the major challenges in this emerging field.","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Cheng-Hai"},{"family":"Lifshitz","given":"Lawrence M."},{"family":"ZhuGe","given":"Ronghua"}],"citation-key":"lu_extraoral_2017","container-title":"Journal of General Physiology","DOI":"10.1085/jgp.201611637","ISSN":"0022-1295","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"181-197","title":"Extraoral Bitter Taste Receptors in Health and Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201611637","volume":"149"},

  {"id":"luo_othering_2023","abstract":"Identifying and understanding implicit attitudes toward food can help efforts to mitigate social prejudice due to food’s pervasive role as a marker of cultural and ethnic identity. Stereotypes about food are a form of microaggression that contribute to harmful public discourse that may in turn perpetuate prejudice toward ethnic groups and negatively impact economic outcomes for restaurants. Through careful linguistic analyses, we evaluate social theories about attitudes toward immigrant cuisine in a large-scale study of framing differences in 2.1M English language Yelp reviews of restaurants in 14 US states. Controlling for factors such as restaurant price and neighborhood racial diversity, we find that immigrant cuisines are more likely to be framed in objectifying and othering terms of authenticity (e.g., authentic, traditional), exoticism (e.g., exotic, different), and prototypicality (e.g., typical, usual), but that non-Western immigrant cuisines (e.g., Indian, Mexican) receive more othering than European cuisines (e.g., French, Italian). We further find that non-Western immigrant cuisines are framed less positively and as lower status, being evaluated in terms of affordability and hygiene. Finally, we show that reviews generated by large language models (LLMs) reproduce many of the same framing tendencies. Our results empirically corroborate social theories of taste and gastronomic stereotyping, and reveal linguistic processes by which such attitudes are reified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Yiwei"},{"family":"Gligorić","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"luo_othering_2023","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,14]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2307.07645","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Othering and low prestige framing of immigrant cuisines in US restaurant reviews and large language models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07645"},

  {"id":"madden_venice_2012","abstract":"Overview: An extraordinary chronicle of Venice, its people, and its grandeur. Thomas Madden's majestic, sprawling history of Venice is the first full portrait of the city in English in almost thirty years. Using long-buried archival material and a wealth of newly translated documents, Madden weaves a spellbinding story of a place and its people, tracing an arc from the city's humble origins as a lagoon refuge to its apex as a vast maritime empire and Renaissance epicenter to its rebirth as a modern tourist hub. Madden explores all aspects of Venice's breathtaking achievements: the construction of its unparalleled navy, its role as an economic powerhouse and birthplace of capitalism, its popularization of opera, the stunning architecture of its watery environs, and more. He sets these in the context of the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire, the endless waves of Crusades to the Holy Land, and the awesome power of Turkish sultans. And perhaps most critically, Madden corrects the stereotype of Shakespeare's money-lending Shylock that has distorted the Venetian character, uncovering instead a much more complex and fascinating story, peopled by men and women whose ingenuity and deep faith profoundly altered the course of civilization","author":[{"family":"Madden","given":"Thomas F."}],"citation-key":"madden_venice_2012","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-101-60113-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 858947744","publisher":"Viking","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Venice: a new history","title-short":"Venice","type":"book"},

Many researches and publications deal with the ancient incense trade, but only a few focus on this trade during the Islamic period. This paper aims to present the results obtained from a multidisciplinary methodology. To identify the main substances used as incense, medieval Arabic sources such as the Kitāb al-nabāt written by Al-AsmacI and Abū Hanīfah al-Dlnawarl, or Ibn al-Baytâr's al-Jãmic li-mufradāt al-adwiyyah wa-H-aghdhiyyah are of great interest.

  {"id":"magyari_hungarian_2022","abstract":"Powerful figures, such as politicians, who show a behavioural pattern of exuberant self-confidence, recklessness, and contempt for others may be the subject of the acquired personality disorder, the hubris syndrome, which has been demonstrated to leave its mark on speech patterns. Our study explores characteristic language patterns of Hungarian prime ministers (PMs) with a special emphasis on one of the key indicators of hubris, the shift from the first person “I” to “we” in spontaneous speech. We analyzed the ratio of the first-person singular (“I”) and plural (“we”) pronouns and verbal inflections in the spontaneous parliamentary speeches of four Hungarian PMs between 1998–2018. We found that Viktor Orba´ n during his second premiership (2010–2014) used first person plural relative to singular inflections more often than the other three PMs during their terms. Orba´ n and another Hungarian PM, Ferenc Gyurcsa´ ny, who were re-elected at some point showed an increased ratio of first-person plural vs. singular inflections and personal pronouns by their second term, likely reflecting increasing hubristic tendencies. The results show that the ratio of “I” and “we” usually studied in English texts also show changes in a structurally different language, Hungarian. This finding suggests that it is extended periods of premiership that may increase hubristic behaviour in political leaders, not only experiencing excessive power. The results are particularly elucidating regarding the role of re-elections in political leaders’ hubristic speech–and behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Magyari","given":"Lilla"},{"family":"Pléh","given":"Csaba"},{"family":"Forgács","given":"Bálint"}],"citation-key":"magyari_hungarian_2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0273226","editor":[{"family":"Landenmark","given":"Hanna"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e0273226","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Hungarian hubris syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273226","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"mahmud_documenting_2018","abstract":"Sundanese literature as other regional literatures all over Indonesia faces the same situation and problem regarding its existence. There have been some efforts made to preserve this local culture either through collaborative researches, national and international publications, or documentation. Faculty of Cultural Sciences Universitas Padjadjaran having Sundanese Study Program has made a documentation of Sundanese folklores taken from areas in West Java under the Sundanese culture as well as from books. The folklores are collected and made into a written documentation. The source text which is written in Sundanese language is then translated into Indonesian language as the first target language and into English as the second target language altogether and is published in a book entitled “The Most Popular Sundanese Folklore: Myth, Legend, and Tales” in cooperation with Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The first background of this research is that although the folklores are taken from different areas of West Java, there are some similar topics involved. The second background is that the translators of the two target languages have both a Sundanese cultural background however they have their own preferable methods in translating the folklore. Based on the two backgrounds, this research aims to identify what similar topics appeared in the folklore and what method of translation is used to transfer the similar contents into Indonesian language and English language studied by using Newmark’s methods of translation. The results show that the first similar topic in the Sundanese folklore is about kingdom including the king and the queen, the prince and princess, then the second is about the childless family, the third is about the existence of snake or dragon, the fourth is about meditating in a forest or a mountain, and the last is relating to Islam or a Moslem. The method of translation used in the translation from Sundanese language into Indonesian language is of SL emphasis while the method used in the translation from Sundanese language into English is of TL emphasis.","author":[{"family":"Mahmud","given":"Erlina Zulkifli"},{"family":"Ampera","given":"Taufik"},{"family":"Sidiq","given":"Inu Isnaeni"}],"citation-key":"mahmud_documenting_2018","container-title":"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"417-429","source":"Zotero","title":"Documenting Sundanese Literature by the Presentation of Its Folklores Written in Three Languages","type":"article-journal","volume":"280"},

  {"id":"manning_open_2018","abstract":"A major new economic history of the ancient Mediterranean world   In <em>The Open Sea</em>, J. G. Manning offers a major new history of economic life in the Mediterranean world in the Iron Age, from Phoenician trading down to the Hellenistic era and the beginning of Rome's imperial supremacy. Drawing on a wide range of ancient sources and the latest social theory, Manning suggests that a search for an illusory single \"ancient economy\" has obscured the diversity of lived experience in the Mediterranean world, including both changes in political economies over time and differences in cultural conceptions of property and money. At the same time, he shows how the region's economies became increasingly interconnected during this period.   <em>The Open Sea</em> argues that the keys to understanding the region's rapid social and economic change during the Iron Age are the variety of economic and political solutions its different cultures devised, the patterns of cross-cultural exchange, and the sharp environmental contrasts between Egypt, the Near East, and Greece and Rome. The book examines long-run drivers of change, such as climate, together with the most important economic institutions of the premodern Mediterranean--coinage, money, agriculture, and private property. It also explores the role of economic growth, states, and legal institutions in the region's various economies.

  {"id":"mark_notes_2018","abstract":"This paper evaluates Chinese lexical data in Shorto’s 2006 Proto-Mon-Khmer reconstructions to prevent misapplication of his reconstructions, which in a few dozen instances are based on problematic data that affect or even refute his reconstructions. First, Shorto notes about 20 Chinese items to consider for their comparable semantic and phonological properties. While several are probable Chinese loanwords spread throughout the region, a majority of these are unlikely to be Chinese as they are either Wanderwörter seen in multiple language families with undetermined origins or, in most cases, simply partial chance similarities, and these latter items can thus be removed from consideration in Proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions. Second, Shorto also listed about 50 Vietnamese words as supporting data for proto-Austroasiatic etyma which are either (a) clearly Sino-Vietnamese readings of Chinese characters (about 20 instances) or (b) Early Sino-Vietnamese colloquial borrowings (about 30 instances). Many of those proposed proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions must be reconsidered due to the exclusion of these Sino-Vietnamese items. While excluding such Sino-Vietnamese or Early Sino-Vietnamese items in some cases has no impact on those reconstructions, other exclusions result in slight changes in the reconstructed forms, and in several cases, proposed reconstructions must be entirely excluded as only Vietnamese and one other branch of Austroasiatic are available as comparative evidence. Finally, both the exclusions of proposed attestations (and the clarification of their actual origin) and the hypotheses of regional spread of Chinese words must be considered not only for Proto-Austroasiatic but also in comparative historical linguistic studies in the region.","author":[{"family":"Mark","given":"Alves"}],"citation-key":"mark_notes_2018","container-title":"Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"lxxvi-xcvii","title":"Notes on Chinese Words in Shorto’s Proto-Austroasiatic Reconstructions","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11"},

Despite their success, most available models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes practical use of such models—in all languages except English—very limited. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of training monolingual Transformer-based language models for other languages, taking French as an example and evaluating our language models on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition and natural language inference tasks. We show that the use of web crawled data is preferable to the use of Wikipedia data. More surprisingly, we show that a relatively small web crawled dataset (4GB) leads to results that are as good as those obtained using larger datasets (130+GB). Our best performing model CamemBERT reaches or improves the state of the art in all four downstream tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Muller","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Suárez","given":"Pedro Javier Ortiz"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Romary","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Clergerie","given":"Éric Villemonte","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Seddah","given":"Djamé"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"}],"citation-key":"martin_camembert_2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.645","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"7203-7219","source":"arXiv.org","title":"CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model","title-short":"CamemBERT","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03894"},

  {"id":"masic_contribution_2017","abstract":"The time interval from the 9th to the 13th century remained known as the “Golden period of the Arab science”, and a significant place among the taught sciences are occupied by Medicine and Pharmacy. In the history of medicine, Islamic medicine, also known as Arabic medicine, refers to the science of medicine developed in the Islamic Golden Age, and written in Arabic Arabs were able to use their cultural and natural resources and trade links to contribute to the strong development of pharmacy. After the collapse of the Arab rule, the Arab territorial expanses and cultural heritage were taken over by the Turks. Although scientific progress in the Turkish period slowed down due to numerous unfavorable political-economic and other circumstances, thanks to the Turks, Arab culture and useful Islamic principles expanded to the territory of our homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Significant role in the transfer of Arabic medical and pharmaceutical knowledge was also attributed to the Sephardic Jews who, with their arrival, continued to perform their attar activities, which were largely based on Arab achievements. However, insufficiently elaborated, rich funds of oriental medical and pharmaceutical handwriting testify that Oriental science has nurtured in these areas as well, and that the Arab component in a specific way was intertwined with other cultures and traditions of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Masic","given":"Izet"},{"family":"Skrbo","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Naser","given":"Nabil"},{"family":"Tandir","given":"Salih"},{"family":"Zunic","given":"Lejla"},{"family":"Medjedovic","given":"Senad"},{"family":"Sukalo","given":"Aziz"}],"citation-key":"masic_contribution_2017","container-title":"Medical Archives","container-title-short":"Med Arch","DOI":"10.5455/medarh.2017.71.364-372","ISSN":"0350-199X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Contribution of Arabic Medicine and Pharmacy to the Development of Health Care Protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina - the First Part","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ejmanager.com/fulltextpdf.php?mno=282485","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"mathe_medicinal_2015","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.","citation-key":"mathe_medicinal_2015","collection-title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-9810-5","editor":[{"family":"Máthé","given":"Ákos"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-9810-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World: Scientific, Production, Commercial and Utilization Aspects","type":"book"},

  {"id":"mcgillivray_applying_2020","abstract":"“McGillivray and Tóth provide a very comprehensible introduction to the most important current approaches of computer-aided text analysis in the Digital Humanities. By giving illustrative examples and many practical tips, they let the reader participate in their vast experience in this quickly evolving field of research.”–Gregor Wiedemann, University of Hamburg, Germany This book presents established and state-of-the-art methods in Language Technology (including text mining, corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing), and demonstrates how they can be applied by humanities scholars working with textual data. The landscape of humanities research has recently changed thanks to the proliferation of big data and large textual collections such as Google Books, Early English Books Online, and Project Gutenberg. These resources have yet to be fully explored by new generations of scholars, and the authors argue that Language Technology has a key role to play in the exploration of large-scale textual data. The authors use a series of illustrative examples from various humanistic disciplines (mainly but not exclusively from History, Classics, and Literary Studies) to demonstrate basic and more complex use-case scenarios. This book will be useful to graduate students and researchers in humanistic disciplines working with textual data, including History, Modern Languages, Literary studies, Classics, and Linguistics. This is also a very useful book for anyone teaching or learning Digital Humanities and interested in the basic concepts from computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and natural language processing. Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge and The Alan Turing Institute, UK. She has published two monographs, Methods in Latin Computational Linguistics (2014) and Quantitative Historical Linguistics. A corpus framework (2017).

  {"id":"mervay_central_","abstract":"Republican China’s struggle for unity and sovereignty coincided with the country’s unprecedented internationalization. In addition to the looming presence of powerful and privileged foreigners, the Nanjing Government faced the challenge of administering destitute refugees from Europe. The history of Russian and Jewish communities in modern China has come to the fore in recent years.

  {"id":"mervay_history_","abstract":"This paper aims to achieve two goals: the first is to bring a fresh perspective to the Atlanto-centric history of Chinese propaganda while tracing the roots of SinoHungarian bilateral approaches and Hungarian Sinology to a time dating some fifteen years earlier than the mutual recognition of the two People’s Republics. This analysis also introduces three actors of different political agendas who applied a similar PR tool of cultural diplomacy to elicit international sympathy for their homeland. After briefly surveying the primary stimuli of cultural diplomacy in interwar Hungary and RepublicanEra China, I turn to pre-1949 Sino-Hungarian cultural approaches in the era of no formal diplomatic relations. Such initiatives offer valuable insights into the history of cultural diplomacy while also highlighting significant parallels with the present. Specifically, I introduce the political and cultural agenda of three individuals acting as cultural ambassadors to their homelands. The Shanghai Jewish refugee aid organizer, Paul Komor, and the women’s association president, Theresia Moll, were members of the Hungarian diaspora in China. They introduced the post-Habsburg Central European region to a cosmopolitan community while exhibiting two different foci: Hungarian irredentism and pan-Danubianism. Meanwhile, Zhenya He, a Kuomintang propagandist and the University of Budapest’s first Chinese language instructor during the 1930s, synthesized Hungarian pan-Asian Turanism with Sun Yat-sen’s Tridemism to further Sino-Hungarian exchanges.","author":[{"family":"Mervay","given":"Mátyás"}],"citation-key":"mervay_history_","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Toward a History of Interwar Sino-Hungarian Cultural Relations: Three Advocates of Kuomintang Soft Power, Hungarian Irredentism and Pan-Danubianism","type":"article-journal"},

But how does food, be it industrial or small scale, local or international, nutritious or unhealthy get to our plate? This book shows us how. Stories that inform us about how food moves from the producer to the consumer are only just appearing and are timely relative to the developments in food distribution. Without understanding the complex and adaptive global food supply chain, consumers, policy makers, and the food industry fail to appreciate the full range of opportunities for innovation. Farmers are increasingly engineers, farms are becoming enclosed vertical structures or laboratories with no plant or animal in sight. Food may arrive on our plates from food printers, lab dishes, or from our very own farms that produce personalized food in our homes. The possibilities and consequences are only now becoming visible. No more an invisible supply chain, the future food system will operate transparently and faster. This is a global story, one that centers on urban centers, connected by a network and infrastructure that includes roads, storage facilities, waterways, ports, highways, and airfreight hubs. These stories also reveal a shift in the way we can think about supplying the global population with food in the future. Could it be that the world already produces enough food for the world now and will continue to do so in the future....and that the critical problem to solve is one of distribution? Could it be that our food will become information, data that will uproot our food system and transplant it into a faster, fresher supply chain that feeds our growing urban populations?\"--","author":[{"family":"Metcalfe","given":"Robyn Shotwell"}],"call-number":"HD9000.5 .M4275 2019","citation-key":"metcalfe_food_2019","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-03965-9 978-0-262-53952-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"195","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Food routes: growing bananas in Iceland and other tales from the logistics of eating","title-short":"Food routes","type":"book"},

  {"id":"mezzavilla_genetic_2014","abstract":"Background The ancient Silk Road has been a trading route between Europe and Central Asia from the 2nd century BCE to the 15th century CE. While most populations on this route have been characterized, the genetic background of others remains poorly understood, and little is known about past migration patterns. The scientific expedition “Marco Polo” has recently collected genetic and phenotypic data in six regions (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan) along the Silk Road to study the genetics of a number of phenotypes.Results We characterized the genetic structure of these populations within a worldwide context. We observed a West-East subdivision albeit the existence of a genetic component shared within Central Asia and nearby populations from Europe and Near East. We observed a contribution of up to 50% from Europe and Asia to most of the populations that have been analyzed. The contribution from Asia dates back to 25 generations and is limited to the Eastern Silk Road. Time and direction of this contribution are consistent with the Mongolian expansion era.Conclusions We clarified the genetic structure of six populations from Central Asia and suggested a complex pattern of gene flow among them. We provided a map of migration events in time and space and we quantified exchanges among populations. Altogether these novel findings will support the future studies aimed at understanding the genetics of the phenotypes that have been collected during the Marco Polo campaign, they will provide insights into the history of these populations, and they will be useful to reconstruct the developments and events that have shaped modern Eurasians genomes.","author":[{"family":"Mezzavilla","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Vozzi","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Pirastu","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Girotto","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Adamo","given":"Pio","non-dropping-particle":"d’"},{"family":"Gasparini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Colonna","given":"Vincenza"}],"citation-key":"mezzavilla_genetic_2014","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/011759","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"011759","title":"Genetic landscape of populations along the Silk Road: admixture and migration patterns","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/24/011759.abstract"},

  {"id":"milburn_aromas_2016","abstract":"Research into early Chinese olfactory culture is only just beginning. This paper argues that before the arrival of Buddhism, elite scent culture had already begun to be transformed by the importation of foreign aromatics, though these substances arrived shorn of their original cultural context. Prior to the importing of intense foreign perfumes, the aromatics available were mostly local, and traditional Chinese practice stressed the use of individual scents in religious contexts, a concept which also had a profound influence on secular usage. The same is true of early osmographies, which link particular kinds of smells–including many that might be considered unpleasant–to the changing seasons. When foreign spices and aromatics arrived in China for the first time, a phenomenon later literature specifically associates with the reign of Han Wudi, this resulted in the development of new complex and powerful perfumes. This in turn may have had a significant impact upon the material culture of Han China, with the spread of personal scenting devices and incense burners.

  {"id":"milton_ministry_2016","abstract":"Six gentlemen, one goal - the destruction of Hitler's war machine In the spring of 1939, a top secret organisation was founded in London: its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler's war machine through spectacular acts of sabotage. The guerrilla campaign that followed was to prove every bit as extraordinary as the six gentlemen who directed it. Winston Churchill selected them because they were wildly creative and thoroughly ungentlemanly. One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the 1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now, his talents were put to more devious use: he built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler's favourite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another member of the team, William Fairbairn, was a portly pensioner with an unusual passion: he was the world's leading expert in silent killing. He was hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind enemy lines. Led by dapper Scotsman Colin Gubbins, these men - along with three others - formed a secret inner circle that planned the most audacious sabotage attacks of the Second World War. Winston Churchill called it his Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. The six 'ministers', aided by a group of formidable ladies, were so effective that they single-handedly changed the course of the war. Told with Giles Milton's trademark verve and eye for detail, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is thoroughly researched and based on hitherto unknown archival material.

  {"id":"ming_zheng_2019","abstract":"In the history of the development of human civilization, the Silk Road has been an important route of traffic and exchange between the East and the West. From Zhang Qian’s 張騫 opening up of the Silk Road across the Western Regions (Xiyue 西域) to Zheng He’s 鄭和 sailing to the Western Oceans (xia xiyang 下西洋) more than 1500 years later, China had a continuous desire to explore beyond its borders. At the time of Zheng He, the term “Western Oceans” (xiyang 西 洋 ) had a specific meaning. As shown by the account of Ma Huan 馬歡, who personally joined Zheng He on the voyages, the people of Ming China considered the “Western Oceans” to be the Namoli Ocean (Namoli yang 那没黎洋), later called the Indian Ocean. Thus, it could be concluded that the Western Oceans where Zheng He’s fleet went meant the Indian Ocean. Even today most scholars still divide the Eastern and Western Oceans at Brunei, with no clear understanding of where the Western Oceans to which Zheng He sailed were actually located. It is therefore important to make clear that the Western Oceans in his time referred to the Indian Ocean, before moving on to investigate the purpose of the voyages and related historical issues. Even more important is to point out that Zheng He’s expeditions in the early fifteenth century reflected that Chinese people took to the seas on a scale larger than ever before and joined the maritime and overland silk routes together. The place where this occurred was the Indian Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ming","given":"Wan"}],"citation-key":"ming_zheng_2019","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101004","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"92-125","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zheng He’s Seven Voyages into the Namoli Ocean–the Indian Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p92_92.xml","volume":"1"},

Formal systems that allow for automated semantic interpretation of law supported by lexical resources can bring forth solutions to legal reasoning tasks. We wish to formalize legal issues in a computable language, using SUMO and its higher-order language to capture the semantics of the legal domain, which in itself is relying on many quasi-logical rules. SUMO is a formal ontology that had 1000 terms and 4000 axioms in the beginning, using those terms in SUO-KIF statements that describe the world. This set has since been expanded to more than 20,000 terms and 80,000 axioms. In this paper, we show how and why legal terms have been represented in SUMO.

In 8th century Baghdad, Arab discoveries augmented Greek learning. Exchange within the thriving Muslim world brought that knowledge to Cordoba, Spain. Toledo became a famous center of translation from Arabic into Latin, a portal through which Greek and Arab ideas reached Western Europe. Salerno, on the Italian coast, was the great center of medical studies, and Sicily, ancient colony of the Greeks, was one of the few places in the West to retain contact with Greek culture and language. Scholars in these cities helped classical ideas make their way to Venice in the 15th century, where printers thrived and the Renaissance took root.

Tying the ingredients of our diet evolution to the growth of human civilization, he immerses readers in the passionate debates and bold inventions that transformed food from a simple staple to a potent factor in health and a symbol of social and ideological standing. Montanari returns to the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, the \"mother of all medical schools,\" to plot the theory of food that took shape in the twelfth century. He reviews the influence of the Near Eastern spice routes, which introduced new flavors and cooking techniques to European kitchens, and reads Europe's earliest cookbooks, which took cues from old Roman practices that valued artifice and mixed flavors. Dishes were largely low-fat, and meats and fish were seasoned with vinegar, citrus juices, and wine. He highlights other dishes, habits, and battles that mirror contemporary culinary identity, including the refinement of pasta, polenta, bread, and other flour-based foods; the transition to more advanced cooking tools and formal dining implements; the controversy over cooking with oil, lard, or butter; dietary regimens; and the consumption and cultural meaning of water and wine. As people became more cognizant of their physicality, individuality, and place in the cosmos, Montanari shows, they adopted a new attitude toward food, investing as much in its pleasure and possibilities as in its acquisition.\"--Jacket","author":[{"family":"Montanari","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Archer Brombert","given":"Beth"}],"call-number":"394.120 940902","citation-key":"montanari_medieval_2015","collection-title":"Arts and traditions of the table","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-16786-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Medieval Tastes: Food, Cooking, and the Table","title-short":"Medieval tastes","type":"book"},

  {"id":"moraga_metabolite_2009","abstract":"Saffron, the desiccated stigmas of Crocus sativus, is highly appreciated for its peculiar colour, ﬂavour and aroma. Several studies have been conducted with the spice, but little is known about the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds generated during the development of the stigma. In this study, we have followed these compounds, with special attention to those of isoprenoid origin (carotenoids and monoterpenes), which are responsible for the organoleptic properties of saffron. The main compounds that accumulated throughout stigma development in C. sativus were crocetin, its glucoside derivatives and picrocrocin, all of which increased as stigmas reached a fully developed stage. The volatile composition of C. sativus stigmas changed notably as stigmas developed with each developmental stage being characterized by a different volatile combination. In red stigmas, b-cyclocitral, the 7,8 cleavage product of b-carotene, was highly produced, suggesting the implication of both b-carotene and zeaxanthin in crocetin formation. As stigmas matured, hydroxy-b-ionone and b-ionone were produced while safranal, the most typical aroma compound of the processed spice, was only detected at low levels. However, a safranalrelated compound 2,2,2-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione (4-oxoisophorone) increased rapidly at the anthesis stage and also in senescent stigmas. Monoterpenes were mainly emitted at the time of anthesis and the emission patterns followed the expression patterns of two putative terpene synthases CsTS1 and CsTS2.

  {"id":"mouritsen_umami_2014","abstract":"In the West, we have identified only four basic tastes--sour, sweet, salty, and bitter--that, through skillful combination and technique, create delicious foods. Yet in many parts of East Asia over the past century, an additional flavor has entered the culinary lexicon: umami, a fifth taste impression that is savory, complex, and wholly distinct. Combining culinary history with recent research into the chemistry, preparation, nutrition, and culture of food, the authors encapsulate what we know to date about the concept of umami, from ancient times to today. Umami can be found in soup stocks, meat dishes, air-dried ham, shellfish, aged cheeses, mushrooms, and ripe tomatoes, and it can enhance other taste substances to produce a transformative gustatory experience. Researchers have also discovered which substances in foodstuffs bring out umami, a breakthrough that allows any casual cook to prepare delicious and more nutritious meals with less fat, salt, and sugar. The implications of harnessing umami are both sensuous and social, enabling us to become more intimate with the subtleties of human taste while making better food choices for ourselves and our families.

But a newly formed interest in natural active compounds brought back the attention toward historical uses of saffron. Understanding different uses of saffron in the past can help us finding the best uses at present. In this study, we reviewed different uses of saffron throughout the history among different nations.\nMethods: ISI web of Science and Medline, along with references of traditional Iranian medicine were searched for historical uses of saffron.\nResults: Saffron has been known since more than 3000 years ago by many nations. It was valued not only as a culinary condiment, but also as a dye, perfume and as a medicinal herb. Its medicinal uses ranged from treating eye problems to genitourinary and many other diseases in various cultures. It was also used as a tonic agent and antidepressant drug among many nations.\nConclusion(s): Saffron has had many different uses such as a food additive and a palliative agent for many human diseases.

One of the oldest crops in the world, cabbage has for millennia provided European and Asian peoples with vitamins A and C ... and babies--a belief lent credence by folktales about infants found \"under a cabbage leaf\" as well as contemporary Cabbage Patch Kids. Cabbage is both a badge of poverty and an emblem of national pride; a food derided as cheap, common, and crass, and an essential ingredient in iconic dishes from sauerkraut to kimchi. Cabbage is also easy to grow, because it contains sulfurous compounds that repel insect pests in the wild--and human diners who smell its distinctive aroma. We can't live without cabbage, but we don't want to stand downwind of it, and in this lively book, Meg Muckenhoupt traces this culinary paradox. From senators' speeches in ancient Rome to South Korean astronauts' luggage, she explores the cultural and chemical basis for cabbage's smelly reputation and enduring popularity. Filled with fascinating facts and recipes for everything from French cabbage soup to sauerkraut chocolate cake, Cabbage is essential reading for both food lovers and historians around the globe--and anyone craving their daily dose of leafy greens.\"--Provided by publisher","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Muckenhoupt","given":"Margaret"}],"citation-key":"muckenhoupt_cabbage_2018","collection-title":"Edible","ISBN":"978-1-78914-044-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 1045580575","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Cabbage: a global history","title-short":"Cabbage","type":"book","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=1847882"},

Drystubble pores over the documents in the hopes of lucrative revelations about the coffee trade. But his spirited young son Frits and romanticsouled German assistant Ernest Stern discover something much more astonishing: a scandal that strikes at the heart of the whole Dutch colonial enterprise...

The core of the orthodoxy consists of three dogmas: gender is a social construct, race is a social construct, and class is a function of privilege. The problem is that all three dogmas are half-truths. They have stifled progress in understanding the rich texture that biology adds to our understanding of the social, political, and economic worlds we live in. It is not a story to be feared. \"There are no monsters in the closet,\" Murray writes, \"no dread doors we must fear opening.\" But it is a story that needs telling.

  {"id":"mwita_adaptation_2009","abstract":"This paper shows the processes that loanwords undergo when they are adapted from Arabic into Kiwahili. The data used is from Bosha (1993) and a constraint-based analysis is used in this paper. Although a number of studies have been carried out on Kiswahili loanwords, none that I know of has used Optimality Theory. This therefore makes the paper different from the others. Issues tackled herein include pitting the faithfulness of Kiswahili’s open syllabicity (NOCODA) against the markedness of the sonority hierarchy (SON-SEQ) in borrowed words. For example, the paper discusses whether to maintain NOCODA when syllabifying “sultani” (chief, ruler, king) as /su.lta.ni/ or whether to look at the sonority of /l/ and /t/ vis-a-vis syllable margin (SONSEQ) and thus syllabify it as /sul.ta.ni/. Occasionally in casual speech this is resolved by inserting a vowel between the consonants thus producing /su.lu.ta.ni/, but at other times prestige overrides well-formedness. Furthermore, this paper also shows that Kiswahili mainly uses vowel epenthesis to repair syllables but other procedures like consonant deletion, cluster tolerance and feature change are also used. It has also been confirmed that Kiswahili is susceptible to consonant clusters within syllables because of its long association with non-Bantu languages, mainly Arabic and English.","author":[{"family":"Mwita","given":"Leonard Chacha"}],"citation-key":"mwita_adaptation_2009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"16","source":"Zotero","title":"The Adaptation of Swahili Loanwords From Arabic: A Constraint-Based Analysis","type":"article-journal"},

Drawing on his own family's history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.Traveling along four prominent trade routes-the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)-Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines.<em>Cumin, Camels, and Caravans</em>demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflict-Arabs and Jews-have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.","author":[{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Gary Paul"}],"citation-key":"nabhan_cumin_2014","collection-title":"California Studies in Food and Culture","event-place":"Berkeley","ISBN":"978-0-520-26720-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Berkeley","title":"Cumin, Camels, and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey","type":"Book","URL":"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520379244/cumin-camels-and-caravans"},

  {"id":"naipaul_masque_2013","abstract":"Like all of V.S. Naipaul's \"travel\" books, The Masque of Africa encompasses a much larger narrative and purpose: to judge the effects of belief (in indigenous animisms, the foreign religions of Christianity and Islam, the cults of leaders and mythical history) upon the progress of civilization. From V.S. Naipaul: \"For my travel books I travel on a theme. And the theme of The Masque of Africa is African belief. I begin in Uganda, at the center of the continent, do Ghana and Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Gabon, and end at the bottom of the continent, in South Africa. My theme is belief, not political or economical life; and yet at the bottom of the continent the political realities are so overwhelming that they have to be taken into account. \"Perhaps an unspoken aspect of my inquiry was the possibility of the subversion of old Africa by the ways of the outside world. The theme held until I got to the South, when the clash of the two ways of thinking and believing became far too one-sided. The skyscrapers of Johannesburg didn't rest on sand. The older world of magic felt fragile, but at the same time had an enduring quality. You felt that it would survive any calamity. \"I had expected that over the great size of Africa the practices of magic would significantly vary. But they didn't. The diviners everywhere wanted to 'throw the bones' to read the future, and the idea of 'energy' remained a constant, to be tapped into by the ritual sacrifice of body parts. In South Africa body parts, mainly of animals, but also of men and women, made a mixture of 'battle medicine.' To witness this, to be given some idea of its power, was to be taken far back to the beginning of things. \"To reach that beginning was the purpose of my book.\" The Masque of Africa is a masterly achievement by one of the world's keenest observers and one of its greatest writers.

Psychologists, medical and legal practitioners, law enforcement officials, and scholars of fiqh have debated the advisability (in debates among health and legal professionals) or the permissibility (among scholars of fiqh) of sex-change. This article asks what historical transformations of the concept of jins/genus have informed the debates and enabled the contemporary dominant concepts and practices that shape them. How has jins come to mean sex and how does this matter? The article first maps out the historical genealogy of these reconfigurations.

  {"id":"neffati_medicinal_2017","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.","author":[{"family":"Neffati","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Najjaa","given":"Hanen"},{"family":"Máthé","given":"Ákos"}],"citation-key":"neffati_medicinal_2017","collection-title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-024-1120-1","event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-024-1119-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World - Africa","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ninfali_antioxidant_2005","abstract":"Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1·5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (sd 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (sd 300) ORAC units (μmol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.","author":[{"family":"Ninfali","given":"Paolino"},{"family":"Mea","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Giorgini","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Rocchi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Bacchiocca","given":"Mara"}],"citation-key":"ninfali_antioxidant_2005","container-title":"British Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1079/BJN20041327","ISSN":"0007-1145","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"257-266","title":"Antioxidant Capacity of Vegetables, Spices and Dressings Relevant to Nutrition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/antioxidant-capacity-of-vegetables-spices-and-dressings-relevant-to-nutrition/183D7C8AB9BB2E0C822812371EF1079D","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"nissim_taste_2017","abstract":"The role of bitter taste—one of the few basic taste modalities—is commonly assumed to signal toxicity and alert animals against consuming harmful compounds. However, it is known that some toxic compounds are not bitter and that many bitter compounds have negligible toxicity while having important health benefits. Here we apply a quantitative analysis of the chemical space to shed light on the bitterness-toxicity relationship. Using the BitterDB dataset of bitter molecules, The BitterPredict prediction tool, and datasets of toxic compounds, we quantify the identity and similarity between bitter and toxic compounds. About 60% of the bitter compounds have documented toxicity and only 56% of the toxic compounds are known or predicted to be bitter. The LD50 value distributions suggest that most of the bitter compounds are not very toxic, but there is a somewhat higher chance of toxicity for known bitter compounds compared to known nonbitter ones. Flavonoids and alpha acids are more common in the bitter dataset compared with the toxic dataset. In contrast, alkaloids are more common in the toxic datasets compared to the bitter dataset. Interestingly, no trend linking LD50 values with the number of activated bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) subtypes is apparent in the currently available data. This is in accord with the newly discovered expression of TAS2Rs in several extra-oral tissues, in which they might be activated by yet unknown endogenous ligands and play nongustatory physiological roles. These results suggest that bitter taste is not a very reliable marker for toxicity, and is likely to have other physiological roles.

  {"id":"norwich_cities_2014","abstract":"Today we take living in cities, with all their attractions and annoyances, for granted. But when did humans first come together to live in large groups, creating an urban landscape? What were these places like to inhabit? More than simply a history of ancient cities, this volume also reveals the art and architecture created by our ancestors, and provides a fascinating exploration of the origins of urbanism, politics, culture, and human interaction. Arranged geographically into five sections, Cities That Shaped the Ancient World takes a global view, beginning in the Near East with the earliest cities such as Ur and Babylon, Troy and Jerusalem. In Africa, the great cities of Ancient Egypt arose, such as Thebes and Amarna. Glorious European metropolises, including Athens and Rome, ringed the Mediterranean, but also stretched to Trier on the turbulent frontier of the Roman Empire. Asia had bustling commercial centers such as Mohenjodaro and Xianyang, while in the Americas the Mesoamerican and Peruvian cultures stamped their presence on the landscape, creating massive structures and extensive urban settlements in the deep jungles and high mountain ranges, including Caral and Teotihuacan.

Written in the racy, readable prose for which author Norwich is famous, this is colorful, character-driven history. He tackles a vast subject--vast in time, from the oldest surviving pyramid to the First World War; vast in geography, from Gibraltar to Jerusalem; and vast in culture, including as it does the civilizations of the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, Greece, Carthage, Rome and Byzantium, the Borgias and the Medicis, Muhammad and El Cid, Napoleon and Nelson, Moslems, Jews and Christians. This book is not a dry record of facts; it is a rackety read about historical figures--dissolute popes and wily emperors, noble-hearted generals and beautiful princesses. Towns are besieged and sacked, kingdoms won and lost. The narrative covers the glories of Constantinople and Venice, and the stirring history of the islands of Malta, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus.--From publisher description","author":[{"family":"Norwich","given":"John Julius"}],"citation-key":"norwich_middle_2010","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-307-38772-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 680643370","publisher":"Vintage eBooks","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Middle Sea: a history of the Mediterranean","title-short":"The Middle Sea","type":"book"},

  {"id":"nouri_alignment_2016","abstract":"This paper presents a method for linking models for aligning linguistic etymological data with models for phylogenetic inference from population genetics. We begin with a large database of genetically related words—sets of cognates—from languages in a language family. We process the cognate sets to obtain a complete alignment of the data. We use the alignments as input to a model developed for phylogenetic reconstruction in population genetics. This is achieved via a natural novel projection of the linguistic data onto genetic primitives. As a result, we induce phylogenies based on aligned linguistic data. We place the method in the context of those reported in the literature, and illustrate its operation on data from the Uralic language family, which results in family trees that are very close to the “true” (expected) phylogenies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nouri","given":"Javad"},{"family":"Yangarber","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"nouri_alignment_2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational           Language Learning","DOI":"10.18653/v1/W16-1905","event-place":"Berlin","event-title":"Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational           Language Learning","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"27-37","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From alignment of etymological data to phylogenetic inference via population genetics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1905"},
  {"id":"nouri_novel_","abstract":"Unsupervised learning of morphological segmentation of words in a language, based only on a large corpus of words, is a challenging task. Evaluation of the learned segmentations is a challenge in itself, due to the inherent ambiguity of the segmentation task. There is no way to posit unique “correct” segmentation for a set of data in an objective way. Two models may arrive at different ways of segmenting the data, which may nonetheless both be valid. Several evaluation methods have been proposed to date, but they do not insist on consistency of the evaluated model. We introduce a new evaluation methodology, which enforces correctness of segmentation boundaries while also assuring consistency of segmentation decisions across the corpus.","author":[{"family":"Nouri","given":"Javad"},{"family":"Yangarber","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"nouri_novel_","language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"A Novel Evaluation Method for Morphological Segmentation","type":"article-journal"},

The samples were composed of Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P and Zn. The highest mineral concentration were measured between 57.70–2962.74mg/kg Al, 1160.04–16452.88mg/kg Ca, 44.83–1799.5mg/kg Fe, 3570.73–27669.72mg/kg K, 477.17–4313.59mg/kg Mg, 1102.62–20912.33mg/kg Na, 443.60–9367.80mg/kg P and 7.18–48.36mg/kg Zn. The highest values of Ca, K and P were established in Foeniculum vulgare (bitter fennel) (16452.88mg/kg), Ocimum minumum (basil) (27669.72mg/kg) and F. vulgare (bitter fennel) (9367.80mg/kg), respectively. The heavy metal contents were determined too low in all samples. Nitrate and nitrite contents of samples were analysed using the phenolicdisulphonic acid method and the diazotisation method of the American Public Health Association, respectively. These nitrate and nitrite values were established to vary widely depending on the different plant species. While nitrate contents were high in most cases and varied from 12.15mg/kg lime flover (Tilia corata) to 238.85mg/kg myrtle (Myrtus communis), nitrite contents were established between 3.69mg/kg sesame (Sesamum indicum) to 52.70mg/kg basil (Ocimum minumum). Generally, nitrate contents of samples were found very high compared with nitrite values.","author":[{"family":"Özcan","given":"M.

  {"id":"papas_sufi_2021","abstract":"\"This volume describes the social and practical aspects of Islamic mysticism (Sufism) across centuries and geographical regions. Its authors seek to transcend ethereal, essentialist and \"spiritualizing\" approaches to Sufism, on the one hand, and purely pragmatic and materialistic explanations of its origins and history, on the other. Covering five topics (Sufism's economy, social role of Sufis, Sufi spaces, politics, and organization), the volume shows that mystics have been active socio-religious agents who could skillfully adjust to the conditions of their time and place, while also managing to forge an alternative way of living, worshiping and thinking. Basing themselves on the most recent research on Sufi institutions, the contributors to this volume substantially expand our understanding of the vicissitudes of Sufism by paying special attention to its organizational and economic dimensions, as well as complex and often ambivalent relations between Sufis and the societies in which they played a wide variety of important and sometimes critical roles.

Using dictionary definitions and Word­ Net databases, we conduct a lexical semantic analysis and establish the various senses “bit­ ter words” can convey. Then, with the help of corpus data we explore the typical themes and contexts the two languages utilize sensory words related to this concept. We observed that figurative uses of bitter in English tend to revolve around ANIMOSITY, while Chinese 苦 ku3 ‘bitter’ frequently expresses SUFFER­ ING. Due to the displeasing character of this human taste experience, conceptualizations of BITTERNESS are overwhelmingly negative. However, we also found that BITTERNESS does not always transmit negative polarity, ex­ pressions such as “a bitter pill to swallow” and “良藥苦口 good medicine tastes bitter” carry an evaluative positivity. Related to linguistic synaesthesia, we found that bitter in English has origins in the tactile sensory domain, and channels this modality when used as a con­ ceptual metaphor for HARSHNESS, describ­ ing colds and winds, or sometimes words.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Liesenfeld","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_animosity_2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the 35th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","event-place":"Shanghai/Online","event-title":"PACLIC","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11]]},"page":"700-710","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Shanghai/Online","source":"Zotero","title":"Animosity and Suffering: Metaphors of BITTERNESS in English and Chinese","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2021.paclic-1.74"},

  {"id":"parti_fragrance_2022","abstract":"Since the legendary “Divine Farmer”, Shennong, and the compendium attributed to him (Shennon Bencao Jing1 神農本草經), Chinese people have strived to collect, describe, and categorize medicinal substances. Throughout the centuries, knowledge of these materials was collated into bencaos – such as the famous Bencao Gangmu (本草綱目) – compendiums containing the many plant-based, animal, and mineral products. Among the thousands of various materials used in Traditional Chinese Medicine however, there are a few special ones that represent exotic, foreign items. Extra-Chinese herbs and plants were systematically recorded as early as the 4th century in the Nanfang Caomu Zhuang2 (南方草木狀) [Plants of the Southern Regions], and many were consequently incorporated not only into the medicine systems, but into culinary traditions as well. Interestingly, many of these items have highly aromatic properties and can be categorized today as culinary spices (ginger, cloves, pepper). and incense (myrrh, frankincense, sandalwood). The history of how and when these exotic elements arrived into TCM has been discussed by other before, including the late botanist Prof. Shiu-Ying Hu.3 In the present study, we expand on this approach and use botanical, historical, philological, and geospatial information to map the exchanges and the approximate trajectories of land and sea routes the products were traded on. We present the results using powerful, interactive visualizations to demonstrate the historical and cultural significance of the arrival (and presence) of these materials into the Chinese medicinal domain.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_fragrance_2022","event-title":"Botanical Symposium 2022: Exploring Innovative Approaches in Chinese Medicines – From Bench to Bedside","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"title":"Fragrance from the periphery and beyond: Mapping the origins of foreign spices in Chinese materia medica","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://event.fourwaves.com/botanicalsymposium2022/abstracts/1ea06222-f8a6-400c-8c92-de4e419a56f3"},
  {"id":"parti_mapping_2023","abstract":"The majority of existing literature on spices is found in the areas of gastronomy, botany, and history. This study investigates spices on a linguistic level and aims to be a comprehensive linguistic account on the items of the spice trade. Some of these dried plant matter were highly desired at certain points in history, due to their attractive aroma and medicinal value, thus they were ideal products of trade early on. Cultural contact and exchange, and the introduction of new cultural items begets situations of language contact and linguistic acculturation, and so in the case of spices, we not only have a set of items that traveled around the world, but also a set of names. This domain is very rich in loanwords and Wanderwörter, but also supplies us with a myriad of cases where spice names are conventional innovations. To make it more interesting, the thesis compares English, Arabic, and Chinese, languages that represent major powers in the spice trade at different times. After selecting a set of 24 spices, I have collected data on their names and related etymologies, and introduced 6 of them in detail regarding their identity, botany, history, spread, and names. The thesis has two main parts. Part one represents the geographic and linguistic diffusion of spices and their names. Basically, I track and explain word origins and subsequent spread by tracing the materials and the propagation of the accompanying Wanderwort. This part relies on philological literature, and tools from historical linguistics, such as etymological research, as well as geospatial visualizations. Part two examines the language of spices, referring to the terminology and nomenclature related to the spice domain from linguistic-cognitive perspectives. Focusing on the structure and components of 360 collected spice names, it is a systematic investigation on how humans name spices: what are the mechanism and motivations behind the naming principles, and how this possibly relates to the salient sensory features of the products (strong gustatory, olfactory, or visual stimuli). Conclusions are made on the connections between the physical properties of the spices, their patterns of diffusion, and the prototypical spices and their effect of naming principles. Besides being a novel and original approach to research and categorize spices from a linguistic point of view, this study offers new insights to our knowledge about wandering loanwords, and the effect of the highly sensory nature of spices in the naming process when adopted by a community. It is also intended to be a basis for a useful working database for future research, and aims to dispel some of the chaos and confusion surrounding spice names.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"}],"citation-key":"parti_mapping_2023","event-place":"Hong Kong","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"English","license":"All rights reserved","number-of-pages":"210","publisher":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Mapping the Language of Spices A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain","title-short":"Mapping the Language of Spices","type":"thesis"},
  {"id":"parti_naming_2022","abstract":"When investigating the linguistic phenomena around the exchange of words along with items of trade in contact situations, linguists already have a good understanding of how loanwords and Wanderwörter operate. In this talk, I will try to approach the same event – linguistic acculturation, the “response in a language to new items that become known through cultural contact” (Cambell & Mixco, 2007) – but focus on words, specifically the names of novel items, that were not simply borrowed, but otherwise “innovated”. Aromatic substances, such as spices and incense, were frequent and practical products of long-distance trade early on, and thus represent an ideal set of cultural items with corresponding names in various languages. The question then is: How do people name spices, and specifically, new spices that they encounter? And what are the motivations and mechanism of the naming process when adopted by a community? We will see that besides borrowing, the strategies involve innovation using internal resources (compounding, blending), semantic shifts (narrowing, broadening, displacement), and the extensions of meaning by way of metonymy or metaphors. By analyzing hundreds of spice names in English, Chinese, and Arabic, I will introduce the typical structural requirements and salient features that influence the creation of a name and theorize how languages “generate” new names for novel materials based on existing prototypes. I will also discuss the highly sensory nature of these substances (taste, fragrance, colour, etc.), and their effect on the naming process.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_naming_2022","event-place":"Korea/Online","event-title":"The 31st Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher-place":"Korea/Online","title":"The Naming Principles of Novel Cultural Items: A Perspective from the Spice Domain","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://jwllp31.github.io/program/"},

  {"id":"pavoni_taste_2018","abstract":"Taste usually occupies the bottom of the sensorial hierarchy, as the quintessentially hedonistic sense, too close to the animal, the elemental and the corporeal, and for this reason disciplined and moralised. At the same time, taste is indissolubly tied to knowledge. To taste is to discriminate, emit judgement, enter an unstable domain of synaesthetic normativity where the certainty of metaphysical categories begins to crumble. This second title in the ‘Law and the Senses’ series explores law using taste as a conceptual and ontological category able to unsettle legal certainties, and a promising tool whereby to investigate the materiality of law’s relation to the world. For what else is law’s reduction of the world into legal categories, if not law’s ingesting the world by tasting it, and emitting moral and legal judgements accordingly? Through various topics including coffee, wine, craft cider and Japanese knotweed, this volume explores the normativities that shape the way taste is felt and categorised, within and beyond subjective, phenomenological and human dimensions. The result is an original interdisciplinary volume – complete with seven speculative ‘recipes’ – dedicated to a rarely explored intersection, with contributions from artists, legal academics, philosophers, anthropologists and sociologists.","citation-key":"pavoni_taste_2018","editor":[{"family":"Pavoni","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Mandic","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Nirta","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos","given":"Andreas"}],"ISBN":"978-1-911534-32-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"University of Westminster Press","title":"Taste","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5vddz9","volume":"2"},

New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else-to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools-false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power-are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs-bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others-\"con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.\" But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Perkins","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"perkins_new_2016","edition":"2","event-place":"Oakland","ISBN":"978-1-62656-675-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1144711375","publisher":"Berrett-Koehler Publishers","publisher-place":"Oakland","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man","type":"book","URL":"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781626566767/?ar"},

  {"id":"peters_bread_2017","abstract":"The purpose of my research is to understand the meaning behind Japanese bread among Japanese people. Although bread is not something native to Japan, the Japanese have for over five hundred years made improvements to bread so it would become palatable to themselves. In the end Japanese people succeeded in creating bread specific to Japan— “Japanese bread”. However, because Japanese bread has been generated specifically for the Japanese, it is not something common in rest of the world. This fact makes it difficult for the Japanese living abroad to obtain Japanese bread amid increasing globalization.    Material collected between February and September 2015 during fieldwork conducted among Japanese people in San Diego, CA, for this study, reveals that most people have begun baking Japanese bread on their own as a result of seeking the bread that can satisfy their appetites. Even though everyone has different motives and goals for bread baking, Japanese women specifically share common features in their baking. Japanese bread baking is not simply for indulging their appetite for Japanese bread but for fulfilling a role as Japanese women. Viewed from the understanding of the traditional notion of “good wives, wise mothers” representing self-sacrifice and devotion to family, Japanese wives and mothers make an effort to learn and bake bread to feed the best food to their families.   A larger aim of this research is to contribute to the field of folklore, especially the study of material culture. The study of foodways and other genres of material culture share the directions and theories of folklore scholarship. Different from other genres of material culture showing the individuals’ identity through subcultural objects, scholars in food studies tend to address staple foods as a source of symbolism in a given culture and the emergence of a cultural identity or a group’s identity through such food. To expand this tradition, I have shown the intimate connection between the Japanese and bread as non-staple food of the Japanese in the individual level by interpreting individuals’ raw voices gathered during fieldwork.","archive":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I; Publicly Available Content Database","archive_location":"1983520799","author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"Arisa Shibagaki"}],"citation-key":"peters_bread_2017","event-place":"Ann Arbor","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"978-0-355-52124-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"297","publisher":"Indiana University","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","title":"Bread and Washoku: Unveiling Japanese Identity Through the Necessity of Bread Baking","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/1983520799?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true"},

  {"id":"petrovska_historical_2012","abstract":"Healing with medicinal plants is as old as mankind itself. The connection between man and his search for drugs in nature dates from the far past, of which there is ample evidence from various sources: written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines. Awareness of medicinal plants usage is a result of the many years of struggles against illnesses due to which man learned to pursue drugs in barks, seeds, fruit bodies, and other parts of the plants. Contemporary science has acknowledged their active action, and it has included in modern pharmacotherapy a range of drugs of plant origin, known by ancient civilizations and used throughout the millennia. The knowledge of the development of ideas related to the usage of medicinal plants as well as the evolution of awareness has increased the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges that have emerged with the spreading of professional services in facilitation of man's life.","author":[{"family":"Petrovska","given":"Biljana Bauer"}],"citation-key":"petrovska_historical_2012","container-title":"Pharmacognosy Reviews","DOI":"10.4103/0973-7847.95849","ISSN":"0973-7847","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"1-5","title":"Historical Review of Medicinal Plants’ Usage","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

But even though nothing can be done about the language itself, some thoughts may be given to the preparation of teaching aids that can make the task of learning Sanskrit less arduous. The present collection of texts comprises 30 specimens from original literary works written in Sanskrit, which have been chosen employing objective criteria regarding script and language, and which are suitable as first reading material for learners who have already acquired a certain familiarity with Sanskrit grammar and lexicon. However, the choice of texts has not been guided by formal criteria alone, but also by considerations regarding content: For the most part, the specimens belong to the narrative genre; they have been taken from narrative literature, from the epics Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana, and from the Purānas.

  {"id":"polo_travels_2015","abstract":"\"Marco Polo was the most famous traveller of his time. His voyages began in 1271 with a visit to China, after which he served the Kublai Khan on numerous diplomatic missions. On his return to the West he was made a prisoner of war and met Rustichello of Pisa, with whom he collaborated on this book. His account of his travels offers a fascinating glimpse of what he encountered abroad: unfamiliar religions, customs and societies; the spices and silks of the East; the precious gems, exotic vegetation and wild beasts of faraway lands. Evoking a remote and long-vanished world with colour and immediacy, Marco's book revolutionized western ideas about the then unknown East and is still one of the greatest travel accounts of all time. For this edition - the first completely new English translation of the Travels in over fifty years - Nigel Cliff has gone back to the original manuscript sources to produce a fresh, authoritative new version. The volume also contains ... an introduction describing the world as it stood on the eve of Polo's departure, and examining the fantastical notions the West had developed of the East\"--Publisher's description","author":[{"family":"Polo","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"polo_travels_2015","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-14-119877-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 896901373","publisher":"Penguin Books","publisher-place":"London","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The travels","translator":[{"family":"Cliff","given":"Nigel"}],"type":"book"},

  {"id":"qian_reexamining_2019","abstract":"\"For hundreds of years, into the twentieth century, the culture groups in the areas we now know as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam shared a great many political and social values, religious beliefs, and artistic and literary traditions. These common cultural features were recorded and transmitted in the same basic written language-classical or literary Chinese (known as guwen/wenyan in China, Kanbun in Japan, Hanmun in Korea, and Hánvan in Vietnam). The umbrella term for this shared language is \"literary Sinitic\"-a term designed to recognize the fact that although guwen/wenyan originally developed in China, it had a vibrant life of its own in other areas of East Asia (i.e., what this study terms the Sinosphere). This huge but understudied body of written documents offers extraordinarily rich resources for examining issues of cultural continuity and change in this important region of the world. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the political and social turmoil in East Asia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all four cultures abandoned their use of literary Sinitic. As a result, a great many documents written in this important script have been ignored, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the relationship between the histories and cultures of premodern East Asia. Like its companion volume, Rethinking the Sinosphere: Poetics, Aesthetics and Identity Formation, this book seeks to fill this gap. One of the primary goals of this study is to break down the intellectual and cultural barriers that have made the Sinosphere difficult to see for itself. These barriers are of two sorts. One is the academic tendency toward intense specialization; most scholars of East Asia focus on a single country, a well-defined period, and an equally well-defined discipline (linguistics, philosophy, history, literature, art, etc.). Another is the tendency of scholars to privilege the country and period they study, and to adhere closely to their disciplinary training and outlook. To break down these barriers, a group of highly accomplished scholars committed to cross-cultural comparisons and interdisciplinary perspectives have been selected for this volume, and the result is a careful and critical examination of the complex cultural interactions that took place in premodern East Asia. Among the many contributions of this study are its examination of different literary genres (including \"classics,\" poetic primers, works for and about women, detective stories, and folksongs), its broad chronological scope (from the eleventh to the twentieth centuries), its equally extensive spatial range (including China, the Xi Xia Kingdom, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea), and its attention to \"minority\" cultures. Another distinctive feature of this volume is its exploration of epistemological and culture change in late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century East Asia Reexamining the Sinosphere: Transmissions and Transformations in East Asia will appeal not only to academic specialists in the histories, philosophies, literary and artistic traditions of East Asia, but also to instructors of college-level courses in East Asian history and culture\"--","call-number":"PL493 .R35 2019","citation-key":"qian_reexamining_2019","collection-title":"Cambria Sinophone world series","editor":[{"family":"Qian","given":"Nanxiu"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Bowei"}],"event-place":"Amherst, NY","ISBN":"978-1-60497-987-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Cambria Press","publisher-place":"Amherst, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Reexamining the Sinosphere: Transmissions and transformations in East Asia","title-short":"Reexamining the Sinosphere","type":"book"},

The most abundant Turkish linguistic traces have remained along the main strategic lines of Ottoman expansion (Thrace—Macedonia—south Serbia—the Raška region—Bosnia and Herzegovina); migrations of the Serb population contributed to their wide reach by disseminating Turkish loanwords far from central Balkan areas. The contacts between the Serbian and Turkish languages occurred in a broad sociolinguistic range dictated by Ottoman conquerors (terminology related to state administration, army, judicial system, commerce, cookery, etc.).","author":[{"family":"Radić","given":"Prvoslav"}],"citation-key":"radic_oriental_","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"On the Oriental Lexicon in the Serbian Language","type":"article-journal"},

Also known as ‘Golden Spice of India’ turmeric has been used in India for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been used in traditional medicine as a household remedy for various diseases, including biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorders, rheumatism and sinusitis. In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric and its constituents mainly curcumin and essential oils shows a wide spectrum of biological actions. These include its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, anticoagulant, antifertility, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, anti-fibrotic, anti-venom, antiulcer, hypotensive and hypocholesteremic activities. Modern interest on turmeric started in 1970's when researchers found that the herb may possess antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Safety evaluation studies indicate that both turmeric and curcumin are well tolerated at a very high dose without any toxic effects. Thus, turmeric and its constituents have the potential for the development of modern medicine for the treatment of various diseases.","author":[{"family":"Rathaur","given":"Preeti"},{"family":"Raja","given":"Waseem"},{"family":"Ramteke","given":"P W"},{"family":"John","given":"Suchit A"}],"citation-key":"rathaur_turmeric_2012","container-title":"Internation Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research","ISSN":"0975-8232","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"1987-1994","source":"Zotero","title":"Turmeric: the Golden Spice of Life","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"reed_genetics_2010","abstract":"Eating is dangerous. While food contains nutrients and calories that animals need to produce heat and energy, it may also contain harmful parasites, bacteria, or chemicals. To guide food selection, the senses of taste and smell have evolved to alert us to the bitter taste of poisons and the sour taste and off-putting smell of spoiled foods. These sensory systems help people and animals to eat defensively, and they provide the brake that helps them avoid ingesting foods that are harmful. But choices about which foods to eat are motivated by more than avoiding the bad; they are also motivated by seeking the good, such as fat and sugar. However, just as not everyone is equally capable of sensing toxins in food, not everyone is equally enthusiastic about consuming high-fat, high-sugar foods. Genetic studies in humans and experimental animals strongly suggest that the liking of sugar and fat is influenced by genotype; likewise, the abilities to detect bitterness and the malodors of rotting food are highly variable among individuals. Understanding the exact genes and genetic differences that affect food intake may provide important clues in obesity treatment by allowing caregivers to tailor dietary recommendations to the chemosensory landscape of each person.","author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Danielle Renee"},{"family":"Knaapila","given":"Antti"}],"citation-key":"reed_genetics_2010","container-title":"Progress in molecular biology and translational science","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-375003-7.00008-X","ISSN":"1878-0814 1877-1173","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"213-240","title":"Genetics of Taste and Smell: Poisons and Pleasures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21036327 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342754/","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"reed_youyang_1995","abstract":"The Youyang zazu is a ninth century miscellany by Duan Chengshi (c. 800-860) It is a collection of anecdotes, tales, lists and bits of information in which we read of historical people and events, supernatural creatures and events, and the various ways that the realm of the supernatural interacts with that of humans. Chapter one is a brief introduction of Youyang zazu. The first part is a general introduction, and the second part is a discussion of the value of the work. The third part of this chapter is a description of the dissertation project. Chapter two is a study of the textual history of Youyang zazu, and a biographical sketch of Duan Chengshi. Chapter three is a study of the content and the formal characteristics of the Youyang zazu. The work is shown to focus on the three primary themes of everyday life, things foreign and the supernatural. The Youyang zazu is shown in this chapter to be made up of four major types of literature. They are the list, the informative piece, the anecdote and the polished anecdote, or tale. Chapter four of the dissertation consists of fully annotated translations of a selection of one-hundred forty-five entries drawn from the collection. The translations are grouped on the basis of formal characteristics. Chapter five is a study and analysis of two of the juan (chapters) of the Youyang zazu. The first part of the chapter focuses on the unusual name shared by these juan and the second part is an analysis of their content, themes and formal characteristics. Chapter six is a fully annotated translation of juan fourteen and fifteen, the two \"Nuogao ji.\" Chapter seven is a discussion of traditional and modern bibliographical treatment of this work. It is shown that not one of the generic labels associated with the Youyang zazu is appropriate as they are defined too narrowly to fit a work as diverse as the Youyang zazu. The second part of this chapter is a discussion of authorial intent.","archive":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I","archive_location":"304240545","author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Carrie Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"reed_youyang_1995","event-place":"Ann Arbor","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"584","publisher":"University of Washington","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","title":"\"Youyang Zazu\": Miscellaneous Morsels From Youyang","type":"thesis","URL":"http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/youyang-zazu-miscellaneous-morsels/docview/304240545/se-2?accountid=16210"},

  {"id":"reyes_flaunting_2017","abstract":"Manila was designated by Spain as the colonial capital of the Philippine archipelago in 1571. From being a small Muslim settlement, the city was swiftly transformed by the trans-Paciﬁc galleon trade to Acapulco. Manila emerged as one of the greatest and wealthiest entrepoˆts in Southeast Asia, rivaling the Dutch city of Batavia in Indonesia and dominating commerce with America and Europe in both silk and spices. Manila became a magnet to trading ships from China, Japan, Maluku, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia, and Borneo, which arrived laden with an astonishing abundance of luxurious goods. The trade ﬂows of silver and precious Asian merchandise—the bales of Chinese silks, the porcelain, Indian textiles, spices, local wax, honey, and forest products—and the shifting and hybrid populations that supplied labor and diverse expertise lent the city its own special character and texture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reyes","given":"Raquel A.

  {"id":"roche_bordering_2022","abstract":"This chapter introduces Nubri Valley – the people, the place, the language – presenting results from a recent sociolinguistic survey that establishes internal variation as well as external pressures on the language. As a community of ethnic Tibetans in Nepal, crossing the border has slowly resulted in a shift of focus towards Kathmandu in many ways. Changing attitudes and evolving social practices are resulting in a marked shift in language use in the younger generations. Superf icially, the Nubri language appears quite vital within the valley. However, I show how an examination of different borders in the sociolinguistic landscape helps leads us to a much clearer understanding of the actual linguistic vitality, revealing a serious threat to its continued survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,9]]},"citation-key":"roche_bordering_2022","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv2wr4xcd","editor":[{"family":"Roche","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Hyslop","given":"Gwendolyn"}],"ISBN":"978-90-485-5271-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bordering Tibetan Languages: Making and Marking Languages in Transnational High Asia","title-short":"Bordering Tibetan Languages","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv2wr4xcd"},

In the first part of the book, the author formulates an epistemological thesis according to which the \"virtual never ended.\" Although the frontiers between the real and the virtual are certainly more porous today, they still exist and endure. In the book's second part, the author offers an ontological reflection on emerging digital technologies as \"imaginative machines.\" He introduces the concept of emagination, arguing that human schematizations are always externalized into technologies, and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms. The author takes an ethical and political stance in the concluding chapter. He resorts to the notion of \"digital habitus\" for claiming that within the digital we are repeatedly being reconducted to an oversimplified image and understanding of ourselves.

  {"id":"ronga_linguistic_2012","abstract":"Recent studies on cortical processing of sensory information highlight the importance of multisensory integration, and define precise rules governing reciprocal influences between inputs of different sensory modalities. We propose that psychophysical interactions between different types of sensory stimuli and linguistic synaesthesia share common origins and mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we compare neurophysiological findings with corpus-based analyses relating to linguistic synaesthesia. Namely, we present Williams’ hypothesis and its recent developments about the hierarchy of synaesthetic pairings, and examine critical aspects of this theory concerning universality, directionality, sensory categories, and usage of corpora. These theoretical issues are verified against linguistic data derived from corpus-based analyses of Italian synaesthetic pairings related to auditory and tactile modalities. Our findings reveal a strong parallel between linguistic synaesthesia and neurophysiological interactions between different sensory stimuli, suggesting that linguistic synaesthesia is affected by tendencies similar to the rules underlying the perceptual association of distinct sensory modalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ronga","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Bazzanella","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Ferdinando"},{"family":"Iannetti","given":"Giandomenico"}],"citation-key":"ronga_linguistic_2012","container-title":"Pragmatics & Cognition","container-title-short":"P&C","DOI":"10.1075/pc.20.1.06ron","ISSN":"0929-0907, 1569-9943","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"135-167","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Linguistic synaesthesia, perceptual synaesthesia, and the interaction between multiple sensory modalities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/pc.20.1.06ron","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"rossi_book_2022","abstract":"The Book of Hours of Louis De Roucy was a magnificent manuscript, illuminated by a pupil of the so-called Master of the Troyes Missal. In the inauspicious date of 2009, like many others, the Book of Hours of Louis De Roucy was also the victim of an act of biblioclasm in Germany. Professor Carla Rossi, thanks to the WayBack Recovery(c) method, has found 99% of the manuscript’s iconographic cycle and over a hundred text leaves, thus digitally reconstructing the book and providing a virtual facsimile edition. In the Office of the Dead’s first lesson, the text is extremely rare and, according to K. Ottosen, is only found in sources from Châlons-en-Champagne. This non-negligible detail, alongside the textual reconstruction of other prayers in the final section of the manuscript, allows for the tracing of its production as well as its first owner in a Champenois environment.  This geographical location gains support (in che senso?) from the All Saints miniature, depicting St Stephen in the foreground, since Stephen himself is infact the patron saint of the cathedral of Châlons-en-Champagne.  In at least six initials appears a heraldic shield, made of a lion rampant azure, langued and armed gules. In the 15th century this shield belonged to Jean VII, Count de Roucy-Pierrepont and Sire de Montmirail, in accordance with the wishes of his mother Jeanne. As a matter of fact, in 1438 she signed a document in which she undertook to leave all her possessions to her son, on condition that the latter used her father’s (Jean VI, Count de Braine and de Roucy-Pierrepont, died at Azincourt in 1415) heraldic coat of arms.  Jean VII, in turn, without any legitimate heirs, left his title as well as his heraldic coat of arms to Louis (1465-1536), his illegitimate son from the relationship with Isabelle de Montchâlons. The teenage male patron depicted on folio 191v, kneeling before the Virgin in a full-page miniature to the 'O intemerata' prayer, is likely Louis himself. The obsessive presence of the De Roucy coat of arms in the manuscript may be explained by the de facto legitimisation of the young aristocrat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossi","given":"Carla"}],"citation-key":"rossi_book_2022","DOI":"10.55456/deroucyboh","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,29]]},"language":"en","publisher":"RECEPTIO Academic Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Book of Hours of Louis De Roucy","type":"book","URL":"https://www.receptioacademic.press/deroucyboh"},

The field of World Englishes has long focused on the sociolinguistic and applied linguistic study of varieties of English. Cultural Linguistics is now opening a new venue for research on World Englishes by exploring cultural conceptualisations underlying different varieties of English. The book explores ways in which the analytical framework of Cultural Linguistics may be employed to study varieties of English around the globe.","author":[{"family":"Sadeghpour","given":"Marzieh"},{"family":"Sharifian","given":"Farzad"}],"citation-key":"sadeghpour_cultural_2021","ISSN":"9789811546969 9811546967","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"title":"Cultural linguistics and world Englishes","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://public.eblib.com/choice/PublicFullRecord.aspx?p=6420870"},

  {"id":"saldanha_itineraries_2011","abstract":"[Jan Huygen van Linschoten's 1596 \"Itinerario\", published in Amsterdam just before Dutch world hegemony, opened the Indian Ocean world for the European geographical imagination, especially regarding its spice markets and non-Christian cultures. Linschoten confirmed rumors in Europe that the Portuguese Estado da Índia had become decadent and unstable, especially in its capital Goa. He also mentioned the absence of Portuguese control in the market of Bantam, which would become the capital of Dutch Indonesia. In addition, the book disclosed nautical and economic information about the Indian Ocean until then carefully guarded by the Portuguese, especially about the Spice Islands. In fact, the book's navigational section was published early so it could be on board the so-called First Voyage organized by the Dutch. This article discusses the main features that made the cartographic, cultural, and economic information of the \"Itinerario\" crucial to this historical expedition. Historicizing the discipline of geography is indispensable for understanding how travel and technology affect what can be known of the planet. Following Foucault's understanding of the production of knowledge, the central argument is that the \"Itinerario\" inaugurated a leap in the Dutch geographical \"episteme\" and a new struggle for the Indian Ocean. Linschoten's humanist scholarship was from the start a multiplicity of knowledges and voices that could be read and used in many ways. ᖖ年，在荷兰建立世界霸权之前，林斯豪滕（ Jan Huygen van Linschoten ）的航海旅行记在阿姆斯特丹出版，该书向欧洲的地理界开启了印度洋世界，特别是有关香料市场和非基督教文化的部分。林斯豪滕证实了在欧洲的传言，即葡萄牙的埃斯塔达印度已经变得腐朽和不稳定，尤其在其首都果阿。他还提到了葡萄牙对万丹市场的缺乏控制，该地区后来成了荷属印度尼西亚的首都。此外，书中还披露了有关印度洋的航海和经济信息，在此之前，这些信息一直被葡萄牙人小心地守护着，尤其是关于香料群岛的信息。事实上，本书的航海章节是提前出版的，为的是赶上由荷兰组织的所谓首航。本文讨论了该航海旅行记在制图学，文化和经济信息方面的主要特点，这些信息对这次历史性的探险是至关重要的。为了理解旅行和技术是如何影响我们认识所在的星球，对地理学科的历史化了解是必不可少的。基于福柯的关于知识产生的认识，本文的中心论点是，林斯豪滕的航海旅行记开创了荷兰地理“知识”的飞跃，并且开启了新一轮对印度洋的争斗。林斯豪滕的人文主义奖学金从一开始就是一个知识和观点的多重体，可以在多方面加以解读和使用。 El \"Itinerario\" de JanHuygen van Linschoten de 1596, publicado en Amsterdam poco antes de la hegemonía holandesa global, abrió el mundo del Océano Índico a la imaginación geográfica de los europeos, en especial lo tocante a sus mercados de especias y culturas no cristianas. Linschoten confirmó los rumores que circulaban en Europa de que el Estado da Índia portugués se había tornado decadente e inestable, especialmente su capital Goa. Él también mencionó la ausencia de control portgugués sobre el mercado de Bantam, que llegaría a ser la capital de la Indonesia holandesa. Además, el libro reveló información náutica y económica sobre el Océano Índico, hasta entonces cuidadosamente ocultada por los portugueses, en particular la relacionada con las Islas de la Especiería. En efecto, la sección del libro sobre navegación se publicó primero, de suerte que pudiese estar a bordo del llamado Primer Viaje organizado por los holandeses. En este artículo se discuten los rasgos principales que convirtieron en crucial la información carográfica, cultural y económica del \"Itinerario\" para esta histórica expedición.

  {"id":"salerno_venice_2022","abstract":"This paper examines the ongoing transition of Venice towards a shortterm city, posited as an urban form which accommodates the dwelling practices of temporary populations as tourists, at the expenses of a stable resident population. This shift is approached through the conceptual framework of resilience, which is also explored in its political and discursive dimensions. At the base of the emergence of a short-term city, we analyse the redistributive impacts of short-term rentals mediated by digital platforms and their influence on the housing market, but also the related entrenchments of a local policy agenda supporting the resilience of the industry itself above that of the city as a living organism. After illustrating the development of the hospitality sector in the city fabric over the last four decades and presenting the historical challenges that Venice has been facing in regard to its capacity to retain a stable population, we seek to unravel the debate on ‘the future of Venice’, which confronts local and global agents defending a ‘conservationist’ approach for Venice as an ineluctably tourist city, with social actors who claim for the defence of residence – and therefore for a ban on STR – as a necessary condition for a socially resilient alternative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Salerno","given":"Giacomo-Maria"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Antonio Paolo"}],"citation-key":"salerno_venice_2022","container-title":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","container-title-short":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","DOI":"10.1080/09669582.2020.1860068","ISSN":"0966-9582, 1747-7646","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1040-1059","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Venice as a <i>short-term city</i> .

The article focuses on the principles and methods of the Dutch behind the expansion process, looking at structural differences as well as similarities of both companies. Although the two organizations were born out of the same anti-Spanish sentiment, the paper argues that the companies differed widely in their aggressiveness, commercial behaviour, financing, and colonial concepts, according to the territory they claimed. Their impact and long-term effects varied considerably, which can be traced partly to the different conditions they faced in non-European parts of the world and the different reactions of their European rivals.]","author":[{"family":"Schnurmann","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"schnurmann_wherever_2003","container-title":"Renaissance Studies","ISSN":"02691213, 14774658","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"474-493","title":"'Wherever profit leads us, to every sea and shore...': the VOC, the WIC, and Dutch methods of globalization in the seventeenth century","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24413463","volume":"17"},

As such, it constitutes a milestone in research on the evolution of the Sinitic language group. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the structure of the Chinese characters, this pathbreaking dictionary places primary emphasis on the sounds and meanings of Sinitic roots. Based on more than three decades of intensive investigation in primary and secondary sources, this completely new dictionary places Old Chinese squarely within the Sino-Tibetan language family (including close consideration of numerous Tiberto-Burman languages), while paying due regard to other language families such as Austroasiatic, Miao-Yao (Hmong-Mien), and Kam-Tai.\" \"Designed for use by nonspecialists and specialists alike, the dictionary is highly accessible, being arranged in alphabetical order and possessed of numerous innovative lexicographical features. Each entry offers one or more possible etymologies as well as reconstructed pronunciations and other relevant data. Words that are morphologically related are grouped together into \"word families\" that attempt to make explicit the derivational or other etymological processes that relate them. The dictionary is preceded by a substantive and significant introduction that outlines the author's views on the linguistic position of Chinese within Asia and details the phonological and morphological properties, to the degree they are known, of the earliest stages of the Chinese language and its ancestor. This introduction, because it both summaries and synthesizes earlier work and makes several original contributions, functions as a useful reference work all on its own.\"–Jacket.","author":[{"family":"Schuessler","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"schuessler_abc_2007","event-place":"Honolulu","ISBN":"978-0-8248-2975-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"publisher":"University of Hawai'i Press","publisher-place":"Honolulu","title":"ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese","type":"book"},

  {"id":"sen_maritime_2014","abstract":"The maritime regions of Southeast Asia played an important but varying role in connecting South Asia and China prior to the sixteenth century. With regard to commercial exchanges, traders, ships, and polities in Southeast Asia facilitated and sometimes controlled the ﬂow of goods. Additionally, merchant associations from South Asia and China established their bases in Southeast Asia to participate in trading activities in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea regions. At least three distinct networks emerged as a result of these maritime interactions: 1) networks of exchanges among the polities skirting the Bay of Bengal; 2) networks that connected the areas around the South China Sea; and 3) networks of direct exchanges between South Asia and China. Buddhist ideas also circulated through these networks, but seem to have made limited inroads in the maritime regions of Southeast Asia prior to the ﬁfth century AD. By this time, Buddhism had already spread widely in China, with signiﬁcant number of Buddhist missionaries arriving in the region through the maritime routes. Rather than playing a staging role in the transmission of Buddhism to China, the doctrine may have penetrated maritime Southeast Asia due to the vibrant Buddhist interactions and a signiﬁcant increase in commercial activity along the networks linking South Asia and China during the fourth and ﬁfth centuries. The use of Buddhism to legitimise new regimes in China and the diplomatic exchanges between Southeast Asian polities and these courts may have also facilitated the spread of Buddhism in the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Tansen"}],"citation-key":"sen_maritime_2014","container-title":"TRaNS: Trans-Regional and -National Studies of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"TRaNS","DOI":"10.1017/trn.2013.15","ISSN":"2051-364X, 2051-3658","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Maritime Southeast Asia Between South Asia and China to the Sixteenth Century","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2051364X1300015X/type/journal_article","volume":"2"},

These episodes in South Asia make it difficult to accept the modern representations of the Zheng He expeditions as diplomatic missions intended to promote peace and harmony.

Vivid and entertaining, it describes the part pepper played in bringing the Europeans, and later the Americans, to Asia and details the fascinating encounters they had there. As Mark Pendergrast, author of Uncommon Grounds, said, 'After reading Marjorie Shaffer's Pepper, you'll reconsider the significance of that grinder or shaker on your dining room table. The pursuit of this wizened berry with the bite changed history in ways you've never dreamed, involving extraordinary voyages, international trade, exotic locales, exploitation, brutality, disease, extinctions, and rebellions, and featuring a set of remarkable characters.' From the abundance of wildlife on the islands of the Indian Ocean, which the Europeans used as stepping stones to India and the East Indies, to colorful accounts of the sultan of Banda Aceh entertaining his European visitors with great banquets and elephant fights, this fascinating book reveals the often surprising story behind one of mankind's most common spices\"–","author":[{"family":"Shaffer","given":"Marjorie"}],"citation-key":"shaffer_pepper_2013","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-312-56989-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher":"Thomas Dunne Books","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Pepper: A History of the World's Most Influential Spice","type":"book"},
  {"id":"shah_sultan_2020","abstract":"The Arabic culinary tradition burst onto the scene in the middle of the tenth century, when al Warraq compiled a culinary treatise titled al Kitab al Tabikh (The Book of Dishes) , containing over 600 recipes. However, it would take another ten centuries for cookery books to be produced in the European continent. For centuries to come, gastronomic writing would remain the sole preserve of the Arab-Muslim world, with cooking manuals and recipe books being produced from Baghdad, Aleppo and Egypt in the East, to Muslim Spain, Morocco and Tunisia in the West. A total of nine complete cookery books have survived from this time, containing a total of nearly four thousand recipes. The Sultan's Feast by the Egyptian Ibn Mubarak Shah in the fifteenth century is one such book. Reflecting the importance of gastronomy in Arab culture, this culinary treatise features more than 330 recipes, from bread-making and omelettes, to sweets, pickling and aromatics, and tips on a range of topics, from essentials a cook should know to how to distil drinkable water.

  {"id":"shahani_tasting_2020","abstract":"Tasting Difference examines early modern discourses of racial, cultural, and religious difference that emerged in the wake of contact with foreign peoples and foreign foods from across the globe. Gitanjali Shahani reimagines the contact zone between Western Europe and the global South in culinary terms, emphasizing the gut rather than the gaze in colonial encounters. From household manuals that instructed English housewives how to use newly imported foodstuffs to \"the spicèd Indian air\" of A Midsummer Night's Dream, from the repurposing of Othello as an early modern pitchman for coffee in ballads to the performance of disgust in travel narratives, Shahani shows how early modern genres negotiated the allure and danger of foreign tastes. Turning maxims such as \"We are what we eat\" on their head, Shahani asks how did<em>we</em> (the colonized subjects) become what you (the colonizing subjects) eat? How did we become alternately the object of fear and appetite, loathing and craving? Shahani takes us back several centuries to the process by which food came to be inscribed with racial character and the racial other came to be marked as edible, showing how the racializing of food began in an era well before chicken tikka masala and Balti cuisine. Bringing into conversation critical paradigms in early modern studies, food studies, and postcolonial studies, she argues that it is in the writing on food and eating that we see among the earliest configurations of racial difference, and it is experienced both as a different taste and as a taste of difference.","author":[{"family":"Shahani","given":"Gitanjali G."}],"citation-key":"shahani_tasting_2020","DOI":"10.7591/j.ctvq2w3d4","event-place":"Ithaca","ISBN":"978-1-5017-4871-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Press","publisher-place":"Ithaca","title":"Tasting Difference: Food, Race, and Cultural Encounters in Early Modern Literature","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctvq2w3d4"},

  {"id":"sharangi_spices_2018","abstract":"Food and nutrition have not only been contributed by biological production through its cultivation and husbandry, it reflects the history and tradition of a nation as well. India has historically been one of the world’s prominent sites for the origin and husbandry of a good score of spices which transcends history nation and culture since time immemorial. The suitability of ecological configuration and meteorological behaviour, the Indian diaspora have carried it forward not only to support her cultural tradition but also to meet up both therapeutic and culinary requirements of spices. From mythology to history, from history to the modern political economy, spices have got a beautiful and aromatic continuity across nations and cultures. The quality of food and its palatability, the nutritive value of food and its therapeutics are nicely contributed by spices. The geospatial distribution in India encompasses hill terrains to rain forest, coastal ecosystem to semi-arid agro-ecology, moist forest ecosystem to rice-based agro-ecosystem in alluvial lands. Spices have got a well-pervading role for integrating ecological diversity and cultural mellifluence. This chapter is designed to keep on unveiling the following aspects of spices in India: history, literature, geospatial distribution over India, the cultural aroma and its socio-economic uniqueness for supporting macro-economy as well as community livelihood generation process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharangi","given":"Amit Baran"},{"family":"Acharya","given":"S.

This robust pattern was found across discourse types (poetic and non-poetic discourse), language boundaries (e.g., English, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese), and historical periods. A cognitive account of this pattern was introduced, according to which this lower-to-higher mapping reflects a cognitively simpler and more basic directionality than the inverse one. Several predictions that follow from this account were tested, using various psychological measures (interpretation generation, recall, difficulty in context generation, and naturalness judgments), and various linguistic forms (nounadjective constructions, and verb phrases with two conjoined modifying adjectives). In accordance with the present account, it was found that the lower-to-higher structure is easier to assign a meaning to, is judged as more natural than its inverse, is better recalled and is judged as easier to construct a context for. Furthermore, sentence ordering is judged as more natural when lower sensory adjectives precede higher ones than in the opposite ordering.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Yeshayahu"},{"family":"Aisenman","given":"Ravid"}],"citation-key":"shen_heard_2008","container-title":"Language and Literature","container-title-short":"Language and Literature","DOI":"10.1177/0963947007088222","ISSN":"0963-9470","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"107-121","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter': Synaesthetic metaphors and cognition","title-short":"`Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter'","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963947007088222","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"shen_how_1998","abstract":"Synaesthesia (e.g. 'sweet silence') consists of the mapping of properties from one modality to another. The present article introduces a cognitive account regarding the directionality of the mapping in poetic discourse. Firstly, we suggest that mapping from lower modalities onto higher ones (e.g. from 'touch' onto 'sight') is more frequently used in poetic discourse than the opposite mapping (i.e. from higher to lower modalities). The findings of a textual analysis of a large-scale poetic corpus are introduced, which support this proposal, and reveal that the 'low to high' mapping is more frequently used than its inverse, and that this tendency is a universal one (across national boundaries and historical periods).Secondly, we propose a cognitive account for this universal tendency according to which the 'low to high' mapping conforms to (while its inverse violates) the following cognitive constraint: mapping from a more accessible concept onto a less accessible one is more natural than its inverse. The findings of an interpretation experiment are introduced, which provide some support for this account by suggesting that the more frequently used structure (i.e. the mapping from the more accessible to the less accessible sense) is easier to comprehend than its inverse.We conclude by proposing that aspects of poetic language are themselves constrained by general cognitive constraints.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Yeshayahu"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Michal"}],"citation-key":"shen_how_1998","container-title":"Language and Literature","container-title-short":"Language and Literature","DOI":"10.1177/096394709800700202","ISSN":"0963-9470","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"language":"en","page":"123-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How Come Silence Is Sweet but Sweetness Is Not Silent: a Cognitive Account of Directionality in Poetic Synaesthesia","title-short":"How come silence is sweet but sweetness is not silent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/096394709800700202","volume":"7"},

They were employed not only in religious contexts but also in the daily language of the common people. Second, new linguistic structures emerged in the course of translating Sanskrit texts into Chinese. This produced a long-lasting effect on the evolution of the Chinese grammar and the formation of Early Modern Chinese.

  {"id":"sidhu_effects_2014","abstract":"Research examining semantic richness effects in visual word recognition has shown that multiple dimensions of meaning are activated in the process of word recognition (e.g., Yap et al., 2012). This research has, however, been limited to nouns. In the present research we extended the semantic richness approach to verb stimuli in order to investigate how verb meanings are represented. We characterized a dimension of relative embodiment for verbs, based on the bodily sense described by Borghi and Cimatti (2010), and collected ratings on that dimension for 687 English verbs. The relative embodiment ratings revealed that bodily experience was judged to be more important to the meanings of some verbs (e.g., dance, breathe) than to others (e.g., evaporate, expect). We then tested the effects of relative embodiment and imageability on verb processing in lexical decision (Experiment 1), action picture naming (Experiment 2), and syntactic classiﬁcation (Experiment 3). In all three experiments results showed facilitatory effects of relative embodiment, but not imageability: latencies were faster for relatively more embodied verbs, even after several other lexical variables were controlled. The results suggest that relative embodiment is an important aspect of verb meaning, and that the semantic richness approach holds promise as a strategy for investigating other aspects of verb meaning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sidhu","given":"David M."},{"family":"Kwan","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."},{"family":"Siakaluk","given":"Paul D."}],"citation-key":"sidhu_effects_2014","container-title":"Acta Psychologica","container-title-short":"Acta Psychologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.02.009","ISSN":"00016918","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of relative embodiment in lexical and semantic processing of verbs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001691814000614","volume":"149"},

  {"id":"smith_entangled_2019","abstract":"Trade flowed across Eurasia, around the Indian Ocean, and over the Mediterranean for millennia, but in the early modern period, larger parts of the globe became connected through these established trade routes. Knowledge, embodied in various people, materials, texts, objects, and practices, also moved and came together along these routes in hubs of exchange where different social and cultural groups intersected and interacted. <em>Entangled Itineraries</em> traces this movement of knowledge across the Eurasian continent from the early years of the Common Era to the nineteenth century, following local goods, techniques, tools, and writings as they traveled and transformed into new material and intellectual objects and ways of knowing. Focusing on nonlinear trajectories of knowledge in motion, this volume follows itineraries that weaved in and out of busy, crowded cosmopolitan cities in China; in the trade hubs of Kucha and Malacca; and in centers of Arabic scholarship, such as Reyy and Baghdad, which resonated in Bursa, Assam, and even as far as southern France. Contributors explore the many ways in which materials, practices, and knowledge systems were transformed and codified as they converged, swelled, at times disappeared, and often reemerged anew.","citation-key":"smith_entangled_2019","editor":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Pamela H."}],"event-place":"Pittsburgh","ISBN":"978-0-8229-6577-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh","title":"Entangled Itineraries: Materials, Practices, and Knowledges across Eurasia","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvh9vzc1"},

  {"id":"solmonson_gin_2012","abstract":"\"Mother's Milk or Blue Ruin, Dutch Courage or Cuckold's Comfort, the fanciful nicknames that gin has acquired only hint at its colourful story. The story begins with the aromatic juniper berry originally used by the Dutch to flavour the whisky-like genever. The drink then made its way to Britain, where cheap imitations laced with turpentine and other caustic fillers made it the drink of choice for poor eighteenth-century Londoners. Eventually replaced by the sweetened Old Tom style and then by London Dry, gin was introduced to the wider world by means of the British Empire, and during the Jazz Age became a mainstay of a new drinking culture: the cocktail. Today classic cocktails like the Gimlet and the Negroni are embraced by drinkers who enjoy a new breed of modern gins, and gin has reclaimed pride of place in the world of mixology. Gin: A Global History will attract both cocktail aficionados and lovers of food history as it chronicles gin's evolution from cheap liquor to modern alcoholic marvel.\"--Publisher description","author":[{"family":"Solmonson","given":"Lesley Jacobs"}],"citation-key":"solmonson_gin_2012","collection-title":"Edible","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-86189-924-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"Gin: A Global History","title-short":"Gin","type":"book"},

Adding freshness and flavour to food and drinks, this versatile sour fruit, also known for resolving diverse health and household troubles, has long been considered vital to Mediterranean and European cookery and cuisine. Lemon: A Global History tells the story of the remarkable adventure of the lemon, starting with its fragrant and mysterious ancestor, the citron, adored by the Greeks and Romans for its fine perfume and sacred to many of the world's great religions. The lemon travelled with Arabs along ancient trade routes, came of age in Sicily and Italy, and sailed to the New World with Columbus. It was an exotic luxury in seventeenth-century Europe and later went on to save the lives of thousands of sailors in the British Royal Navy after being recognized as a cure for scurvy. The last century saw the lemon's rise to commercial success in a California citrus empire as well as the discovery of new varieties.

  {"id":"sood_asafoetida_2020","abstract":"Asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida) also known as heeng, Devil’s drug, ferula, food of Gods, incense of Devil, stinking gum is an important spice crop belonging to family Apiaceae. It is native to Iran and Afghanistan. Its dried latex (gum oleoresin) is generally used for flavouring curries, sauces, and pickles. Therapeutically, it stimulates the intestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the nervous system. It is beneficial in asthma, whooping cough, and chronic bronchitis. Its essential oil is also used in medicines, food and cosmetic industries. Besides, it is also used as an alternative for pesticides in organic farming. The major constituents of asafoetida are the resin (40–64%), gum (25%) and essential oil (10–17%). The butyl propenyl disulphide is responsible for the aroma of asafoetida. The asaresinotannol is the major constituent present in the resin. It can be grown on unproductive cold deserts of dry temperate areas of Himalayas. It is mainly propagated by seeds. The seeds are sown either in winters or spring. It becomes ready for harvesting after 5 years of planting and yields around 900g per plant. The oleo gum resin and essential oil derived from this plant are sold at premium prices in the international market. The small and marginal farmers of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba can benefit from this new emerging crop.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sood","given":"Ruchi"}],"citation-key":"sood_asafoetida_2020","container-title":"Journal of Applied and Natural Science","container-title-short":"JANS","DOI":"10.31018/jans.v12i4.2418","ISSN":"2231-5209, 0974-9411","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,9]]},"language":"en","page":"607-617","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida): A high-value crop suitable for the cold desert of Himachal Pradesh, India","title-short":"Asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ansfoundation.org/index.php/jans/article/view/2418","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"speed_odor_2023","abstract":"Odor and color are strongly associated. Numerous studies demonstrate consistent odor-color associations, as well as effects of color on odor perception and language. Yet, we know little about how these associations arise. Here, we test whether language is a possible mediator of odor-color associations, speciﬁcally whether odor-color associations are mediated by implicit odor naming. In two experiments, we used an interference paradigm to prevent the verbalization of odors during an odor-color matching task. If participants generate color associations subsequent to labeling an odor, interfering with verbalization during the task should affect the ability to make color associations. In Experiment 1, contrary to our hypothesis, verbal interference did not affect odor-color matches. However, since performance accuracy on the verbal interference task was high, it is possible our task did not sufﬁciently disrupt verbal processing. In Experiment 2, we, therefore, used an active verbal interference task, and still found no difference across interference conditions. Odor naming accuracy, odor familiarity, and odor pleasantness, however, did predict odor-color matches. This suggests that although color associations are related to semantic factors, they are not generated by recruiting odor labels in the moment. Overall, our results do not provide evidence that language plays an online role in odor-color associations, instead, they are consistent with the claim that language may have shaped associations during development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Speed","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"De Valk","given":"Josje"},{"family":"Croijmans","given":"Ilja"},{"family":"Huisman","given":"John L.

  {"id":"srinivasan_black_2007","abstract":"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is one of the most widely used among spices. It is valued for its distinct biting quality attributed to the alkaloid, piperine. Black pepper is used not only in human dietaries but also for a variety of other purposes such as medicinal, as a preservative, and in perfumery. Many physiological effects of black pepper, its extracts, or its major active principle, piperine, have been reported in recent decades. Dietary piperine, by favorably stimulating the digestive enzymes of pancreas, enhances the digestive capacity and signiﬁcantly reduces the gastrointestinal food transit time. Piperine has been demonstrated in in vitro studies to protect against oxidative damage by inhibiting or quenching free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Black pepper or piperine treatment has also been evidenced to lower lipid peroxidation in vivo and beneﬁcially inﬂuence cellular thiol status, antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes in a number of experimental situations of oxidative stress. The most far-reaching attribute of piperine has been its inhibitory inﬂuence on enzymatic drug biotransforming reactions in the liver. It strongly inhibits hepatic and intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Piperine has been documented to enhance the bioavailability of a number of therapeutic drugs as well as phytochemicals by this very property. Piperine’s bioavailability enhancing property is also partly attributed to increased absorption as a result of its effect on the ultrastructure of intestinal brush border. Although initially there were a few controversial reports regarding its safety as a food additive, such evidence has been questionable, and later studies have established the safety of black pepper or its active principle, piperine, in several animal studies. Piperine, while it is non-genotoxic, has in fact been found to possess anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor inﬂuences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"srinivasan_black_2007","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","container-title-short":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408390601062054","ISSN":"1040-8398, 1549-7852","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,25]]},"language":"en","page":"735-748","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black Pepper and its Pungent Principle-Piperine: A Review of Diverse Physiological Effects","title-short":"Black Pepper and its Pungent Principle-Piperine","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408390601062054","volume":"47"},

In addition to its superior coverage, a corpus-based approach allows us to quantify the frequency of individual metaphors, and I show how central metaphors can be identified on the basis of such quantitative data. Finally, I argue that a focus on metaphors associated with individual lexical items opens up the possibility of investigating the interaction between metaphor and lexical semantics.","author":[{"family":"Stefanowitsch","given":"Anatol"}],"citation-key":"stefanowitsch_words_","language":"en","page":"44","source":"Zotero","title":"Words and their metaphors: A corpus-based approach","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"steiner_john_2021","abstract":"What would medieval English literature look like if we viewed it through the lens of the compendium? In that case, Chaucer’s contemporary, John Trevisa, might come into focus as the major author of the fourteenth century. Trevisa (d. 1402) made a career of translating big informational Latin texts into English prose, supported by the patronage of the baron Thomas de Berkeley (1352–1417). These included Ranulph Higden’s\n              Polychronicon,\n              an enormous universal history with continuations to the present; Bartholomaeus Anglicus’s well-known natural encyclopedia\n              De proprietatibus rerum\n              ; and Giles of Rome’s beloved advice-for-princes manual,\n              De regimine principum.\n              These were shrewd choices, accessible and on trend:\n              De proprietatibus rerum\n              and\n              De regimine principum\n              had already been translated into French and copied in deluxe manuscripts for the French and English nobility, and the\n              Polychronicon\n              had been circulating England for several decades. This book argues that John Trevisa’s translations of compendious texts disclose an alternative literary history by way of medieval information culture. Modern readers typically encounter medieval English literature through Trevisa’s contemporaries, Chaucer, Gower, and Langland, a triumvirate representing a range of literary styles and languages formative to English letters. How might the nature of this encounter change if Trevisa was in the mix? Can big informational genres give us a purchase on medieval English poetry and prose? And how might Trevisa’s oeuvre enable us to envision a new literary history rooted in the compilation and translation of compendious information alongside texts traditionally labeled as literary?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Steiner","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"steiner_john_2021","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780192896902.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-289690-2 978-0-19-191918-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"John Trevisa's Information Age: Knowledge and the Pursuit of Literature, c. 1400","title-short":"John Trevisa's Information Age","type":"book","URL":"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780192896902.001.0001/oso-9780192896902"},

  {"id":"striklievers_synaesthesia_2015","abstract":"In the existing literature on synaesthetic metaphors in poetry it is proposed that transfers tend to go from the ‘lower’ (touch, smell, taste) to the ‘higher’ (sight, hearing) sensory modalities. The purpose of this article is to establish if the same directionality also holds for synaesthetic associations found in other text types. To this end, a method for the semi-automatic extraction of synaesthesia is introduced and applied to general-purpose corpora of English (ukWaC) and Italian (itWaC). In the data collected for these languages, most transfers proceed in the expected direction, e.g.\n              sweet voice\n              , but instances of ‘backward’ transfers are also found, e.g.\n              bitter cold\n              . Based on these results, it is claimed that the ‘directionality principle’ reflects the\n              frequency\n              of association types, rather than representing universal constraints on synaesthetic transfers, as has often been more or less explicitly assumed. It is here argued that both properties of human perception and more strictly linguistic factors can account for the frequency tendencies observed in synaesthesia. The proposed interpretation is also shown to account for apparently contradictory evidence coming from typological studies on verbs of perception.","author":[{"family":"Strik Lievers","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"striklievers_synaesthesia_2015","container-title":"Functions of Language","container-title-short":"FOL","DOI":"10.1075/fol.22.1.04str","ISSN":"0929-998X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"69-95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Synaesthesia: A Corpus-based Study of Cross-modal Directionality","title-short":"Synaesthesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/fol.22.1.04str","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"sun_gudaixiangshileicihuiyanjiu_2020","abstract":"Ancient incens vocabulary is part of ancient Chinese vocabulary，This article uses a combination of synchronic and diachronic,description and interpretation,and literature and physical research to study the ancient incense vocabulary. The chapter one sorts and classifies incense vocabulary in ancient documents and classics and focuses on the four types of vocabulary of incense names,incense words,incense actions and other incense words.Describe and analyze the meaning of important words in each type of vocabulary. The chapter two studies the formation and development of incense vocabulary. Incense vocabulary is mainly generated by absorbing the common language components of the whole people,creating new words and foreign words.Absorbing the common language components of the whole people includes borrowing in general,transformation borrowing,metaphorical borrowing,and transfer borrowing.The emergence and development of incense has led to the emergence of new words. Explore the four situations of the enlargement,reduction,transfer and extinction of the meaning of incense words.The foreign words play an important role in the evolution of incense vocabulary.The foreign words in the incense vocabulary are examined and demonstrated and the characteristics of the foreign words are analyzed. The chapter three discusses the word formation of incense words from the perspective of morphemes.There are simple words and compound words.The simple words of incense vocabulary include reduplicated words and conjunctions.Compound words are the main way of word formation in Xiangshi vocabulary.It mainly studies four ways of word formation, which are combination,subject predicate, verb object and partial formal. The chapter four studies the phenomenon of incongruity words with the same name and different names,and analyzes the causes of these two phenomena.There are a lot of synonyms with similar names in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for such words include color factors,morphological factors,trait factors,origin factors,modification factors,rhetoric factors,space-time factors,elegant factors and social factors；There are words with the same name in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for this type of vocabulary include color factor,shape factor,shape factor,texture factor,beautification factor,and generic factor.","archive":"CNKI","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhumei"}],"citation-key":"sun_gudaixiangshileicihuiyanjiu_2020","contributor":[{"literal":"孙竹梅"}],"event-place":"Nanjing","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"Chinese","publisher":"Nanjing Normal University","publisher-place":"Nanjing","title":"古代香事类词汇研究 [A Study on the Vocabulary of Ancient Fragrances]","type":"thesis","URL":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFD202101&filename=1021514945.nh&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=bdAREjNDBkguQnPUl44YLbOXVui8RQ6Fu_jr_8C8EHAbnYxr8oU1ID5koWGGttZ5"},

Among the most sought-after was the bird of paradise. Their magnificent plumes bedecked the hats of fashion-conscious women in Europe and America, provided regalia for the Kings of Nepal, and decorated the headdresses of Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire. Plumes from Paradise tells the story of this interaction, and of the economic, political, social and cultural consequence for the island's inhabitants. It traces 400 years of economic and political history, culminating in the 'plume boom' of the early part of the 20th century, when an unprecedented number of outsiders flocked to the island's coasts and hinterlands. The story teems with the variety of people involved: New Guineans, Indonesians, Chinese, Europeans, hunters, traders, natural historians and their collectors, officials, missionaries, planters, miners, adventurers of every kind. In the wings were the conservationists, whose efforts brought the slaughter of the plume boom to an end and ushered in an era of comparative isolation for the island that lasted until World War II.","author":[{"family":"Swadling","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Laba","given":"Billai"}],"citation-key":"swadling_plumes_2019","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv10vkzrf","ISBN":"978-1-74332-544-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Sydney University Press","title":"Plumes from Paradise: Trade Cycles in Outer Southeast Asia and their Impact on New Guinea and Nearby Islands Until 1920","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv10vkzrf"},

The popular Singaporean–English phrase “Die die must try” is not so much hyperbole as it is a reflection of the lengths that Singaporeans will go to find great dishes. This book argues that in a society that has undergone substantial change in a relatively short amount of time, food serves Singaporeans as a poignant connection to the past. Covering the period from British settlement in 1819 to the present and focusing on the post-1965 postcolonial era, the book tells the story of Singapore through the production and consumption of food. Analyzing a variety of sources that range from cookbooks to architectural and city plans, the book offers a thematic history of this unusual country, which was colonized by the British and operated as a port within Malaya, but which is without a substantial pre-colonial history. Connecting food culture to the larger history of Singapore, the book discusses various topics including domesticity and home economics, housing and architecture, advertising, and the regulation of food-related manners and public behavior such as hawking, littering, and chewing gum. Moving away from the predominantly political and economic focus of other histories of Singapore, the book provides an important alternative reading of Singaporean society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarulevicz","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"tarulevicz_eating_2013","DOI":"10.5406/illinois/9780252038099.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-252-03809-9 978-0-252-09536-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Eating Her Curries and Kway: A Cultural History of Food in Singapore","title-short":"Eating Her Curries and Kway","type":"book","URL":"http://illinois.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5406/illinois/9780252038099.001.0001/upso-9780252038099"},

  {"id":"tinney_journey_2019","abstract":"The Penn Museum has a long and storied history of research and archaeological exploration in the ancient Middle East. This book highlights this rich depth of knowledge while also serving as a companion volume to the Museum's signature Middle East Galleries opening in April 2018. This edited volume includes chapters and integrated short, focused pieces from Museum curators and staff actively involved in the detailed planning of the new galleries. In addition to highlighting the most remarkable and interesting objects in the Museum's extraordinary Middle East collections, this volume illuminates the primary themes within these galleries (make, settle, connect, organize, and believe) and provides a larger context within which to understand them. The ancient Middle East is home to the first urban settlements in human history, dating to the fourth millennium BCE; therefore, tracing this move toward city life figures prominently in the book. The topic of urbanization, how it came about and how these early steps still impact our daily lives, is explored from regional and localized perspectives, bringing us from Mesopotamia (Ur, Uruk, and Nippur) to Islamic and Persianate cites (Rayy and Isfahan) and, finally, connecting back to life in modern Philadelphia. Through examination of topics such as landscape, resources, trade, religious belief and burial practices, daily life, and nomads, this very important human journey is investigated both broadly and with specific case studies.","author":[{"family":"Tinney","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Sonik","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"tinney_journey_2019","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv16t6dn3","ISBN":"978-1-931707-14-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","title":"Journey to the City: A Companion to the Middle East Galleries at the Penn Museum","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv16t6dn3 https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv16t6dn3?refreqid=excelsior%3Acbc1ba6b7295def5820cfaae72d6f222"},

By contrast, the study of the early stages of academic and cultural Orientalism has been neglected. For the beginnings of Oriental studies in Europe one still largely relies on institutional histories and archival research, or even V. V. Barthold's 80-year-old study. The birth of academic Orientalism in the 17th century was occasioned by three major factors: a renewed interest in Islam, major advances in travel and exploration, and the emergence of modern approaches to science and education. Among important background developments were the decline of the perceived Arab threat followed by the rise of a very real Ottoman Turkish one, the geographical shift in hostilities from the European West to the East, and the realignment of European alliances and attitudes in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Tolmacheva","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"tolmacheva_medieval_1995","container-title":"International Journal of Middle East Studies","container-title-short":"Int.

Tocharians had dealings with all neighbouring Iranian peoples, but Khotanese and its ancestors clearly exerted the most durable influence. No loan word from more remote dialects (e.g. Persian and Ossetic) can be evidenced. The predominance of war-related and political vocabulary among the loan words and the direction of borrowing, overwhelmingly from Iranian to Tocharian, both point to a political ascendancy of Sakan-speaking tribes, and later of Bactria, on Tocharians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tremblay","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"tremblay_iranotocharica_2005","container-title":"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies","container-title-short":"Bull.

  {"id":"tresso_india_2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The famous Moroccan traveller Muḥammad b. Baṭṭūṭa, who left Tangier in 1325, claims to have made a journey that took him across most of the then Islamicate world. The country in which he recounts having stayed the longest was India, where he says he remained from 1333 to 1341/1342, mostly in the Islamic Sultanate of Delhi. A long section of his\n              Riḥla\n              is dedicated to the sub-continent and modern historians of this region ascribe to it an important documentary value, although it has been argued that Ibn Baṭṭūṭa may have borrowed – not to imply copied – information from other sources in other parts of the work. As concerns India, Ibn Baṭṭūṭa speaks of two epidemics and one deadly disease that occurred in 1334–5 and 1344. Some scholars have referred to them as cholera, while others have suggested it was the plague – thus supporting the hypothesis that the medieval plague pandemic had struck India before reaching the Middle East. How did this confusion arise? What exactly does Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              relate? Do Indo-Persian sources confirm these epidemics? Do they and/or Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              allow us to discount the presence of the Medieval Plague in India, or rather do they assert it?\n            \n            \n              In order to answer these questions, this paper analyses the information on the Indian epidemics in Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              and compares the text with its translations in the principal European languages and with Indo-Persian chronicles. These analyses reveal something of a lexical muddle which, in my opinion, has contributed to some errors and misunderstandings regarding the diseases in question. But another question arises: is it possible to read the information provided by Ibn Baṭṭūṭa and the Indian chronicles in a consilient way, that is, taking into account not only the analysis of written documents, but also the recent and current findings in genetics of plague, and in particular on the Black Death? Finally, an attempt is made to answer a question that has to be asked, particularly in light of the criticism often levelled at Ibn Baṭṭūṭa. Considering that in one of these events he claims to have witnessed the epidemic, is there any reason to suppose that he did not? Regarding the other two events that he did not claim to witness firsthand, is there any cause to doubt his claims?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tresso","given":"Claudia Maria"}],"citation-key":"tresso_india_2023","container-title":"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies","container-title-short":"Bull.

Were Welsh-speaking slaves truly responsible for the loss of English morphology? This latest collection of Peter Trudgill's most seminal articles explores these questions and more. Focused around the theme of sociolinguistics and language change across deep historical millennia (the Palaeolithic era to the Early Middle Ages), the essays explore topics in historical linguistics, dialectology, sociolinguistics, language change, linguistic typology, geolinguistics, and language contact phenomena. Each paper is fully updated for this volume, and includes linking commentaries and summaries, for easy cross-reference.

But what leads people to take risks in everyday life is the hope of gaining an advantage -usually a financial one. If we consider European economic activity before the \"discovery\" of the New World by Christopher Columbus, it is clear that it was mainly the centers of the spice trade where wealth was accumulated. The palaces of Venice and Genoa, the riches of the Fugger and Welser merchant families of southern Germany, and the splendor of Lisbon and Amsterdam were established mainly on the profits from the spice trade. The route the spices took from the East Indies to the Occident was both difficult and dangerous. The spices were mostly harvested by slaves, and then sailed or paddled in tiny praos from the Spice Islands (the Moluccas) to Malacca. From there, they were shipped in junks across two or three dangerous tropical seas. After that, this freight was carried on camelback through the desert from Aden to Egypt, becoming more expensive at each stage. Emirs, sultans, and pirates levied high customs tariffs on whatever had not been lost to typhoons, sandstorms, or other pirates. The exotic freight passed through at least a dozen hands before it was received by European merchant firms in Alexandria or Constantinople.","author":[{"family":"Udo","given":"Pollmer"}],"citation-key":"udo_spice_2000","container-title":"Migration & Diffusion","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"title":"THE SPICE TRADE AND ITS IMPORTANCE FOR EUROPEAN EXPANSION","type":"Journal Article","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"vandam_arabic_2010","abstract":"How did Arabic loanwords end up in Indonesian? Various academic answers to this intriguing question have been put forward, but only rarely has any solid linguistic 'proof' been provided. General conclusions have been drawn on the basis of a few, rather unrepresentative or obsolete, examples. Academics have copied arguments and hypotheses from one another, without any independent research into their reliability. Some of the arguments, or pure hypotheses, have obtained the status of pseudo 'established fact', irrespective of the fact that they lack academic justification. This article makes an effort to put the record straight by showing that a Persian or Persianized connection cannot be proven statistically, as claimed by Stuart Campbell. It also shows that some loanwords have a colloquial, occasionaly even regionally identifiable Arabic origin, but that the claim by Versteegh and others of a South Arabian or Hadrami connection cannot be convincingly established. It finally demonstrates that more attention should be given to the linguistic particularities of the recipient (Indonesian/Nusantara) language, than to concentrate mainly on the characteristics of the Arabic language which provided these loanwords. Unknown Arabic phonemes deserve special attention because they were in some cases interpreted and adopted by Indonesian/Nusantara listeners as phonemes that were phonetically nearest to these, and which were part of their own phoneme system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dam","given":"Nikolaos"}],"citation-key":"vandam_arabic_2010","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"Bijdr taal land volkenkd","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-90003617","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"218-243","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Arabic loanwords in Indonesian revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bki/166/2-3/article-p218_3.xml","volume":"166"},
  {"id":"vanderveen_agricultural_2010","abstract":"[Agricultural innovations are primarily concerned with a need for increasing production (of food, fodder, secondary products) as well as enhancing quality (of produce, production process, growing conditions). This paper reviews current thinking on how improvements and innovations in agriculture arise, what forms they take and what agents are involved. Innovations typically affect one or more of the following areas: crops, animals, growing conditions, implements and management practices. While 'macro-inventions' (radical new ideas) do occur, many concern 'micro-inventions', that is changes or modifications to tools and practices made by skilled practitioners (farmers, craftspeople), rather than by inventors or entrepreneurs. Indeed, agricultural innovations frequently concern not so much the adoption of newly introduced technologies, but the adaptation of existing ones. The term 'agricultural revolution' tends to be used when a number of improvements in separate areas of the farming system co-occur as a complex, and, although these may be introduced gradually, once they reach a critical mass their impact on society may be of a magnitude deserving of the term 'revolution'.]","author":[{"family":"Veen","given":"Marijke","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"vanderveen_agricultural_2010","container-title":"World Archaeology","ISSN":"00438243, 14701375","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"1-12","title":"Agricultural innovation: invention and adoption or change and adaptation?","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25679724","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"vanderveen_when_2003","abstract":"[This paper explores definitions of luxury foods and considers the role of luxuries in marking social distinction. It is proposed that luxury foods are those foods that offer a refinement in texture, taste, fat content or other quality (such as stimulant or inebriant) and offer distinction, because of either their quantity or quality. Ethnographic research has revealed that an emphasis on quantity of food and elaboration of common staples is found mostly in societies without strong social stratification, while an emphasis on quality and style is characteristic of societies with institutionalized forms of social ranking. In the former context the consumption of luxury foods is used primarily to create or enhance social bonds, in the latter to create or enhance exclusivity and distance. The archaeological recognition of luxury foods is reviewed to demonstrate how archaeology is well placed to add regional breadth and chronological depth to the study of the changing role and meaning of luxury foods.]","author":[{"family":"Veen","given":"Marijke","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"vanderveen_when_2003","container-title":"World Archaeology","ISSN":"00438243, 14701375","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"405-427","title":"When Is Food a Luxury?","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3560194","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"vasconcelos_antibacterial_2018","abstract":"Background In the current healthcare environment, an alarming rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections has led to a global health threat. The lack of new antibiotics has created a need for developing alternative strategies. Objective Understanding the antibacterial mechanisms of cinnamon and its constituents is crucial to enhance it as a potential new source of antibiotic. The objective of this review is to provide a compilation of all described mechanisms of antibacterial action of cinnamon and its constituents and synergism with commercial antibiotics in order to better understand how cinnamon and its constituents can collaborate as alternative treatment to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Methods The relevant references on antibacterial activities of cinnamon and its constituents were searched. Meanwhile, the references were classified according to the type of mechanism of action against bacteria. Relationships of cinnamon or its constituents and antibiotics were also analyzed and summarized. Results Cinnamon extracts, essential oils, and their compounds have been reported to inhibit bacteria by damaging cell membrane; altering the lipid profile; inhibiting ATPases, cell division, membrane porins, motility, and biofilm formation; and via anti-quorum sensing effects. Conclusion This review describes the antibacterial effects of cinnamon and its constituents, such as cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The review also provides an overview of the current knowledge of the primary modes of action of these compounds as well as the synergistic interactions between cinnamon or its constituents with known antibacterial agents. This information will be useful in improving the effectiveness of therapeutics based on these compounds.","author":[{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"N.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.","author":[{"family":"Vaswani","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Uszkoreit","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Llion"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Aidan N"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Polosukhin","given":"Illia"}],"citation-key":"vaswani_attention_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Attention is All you Need","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"vazquez-fresno_herbs_2019","abstract":"Culinary herbs and spices have been used as both food flavoring and food preservative agents for centuries. Moreover, due to their known and presumptive health benefits, herbs and spices have also been used in medical practices since ancient times. Some of the health effects attributed to herbs and spices include antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects as well as potential protection against cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. While interest in herbs and spices as medicinal agents remains high and their use in foods continues to grow, there have been remarkably few studies that have attempted to track the dietary intake of herbs and spices and even fewer that have tried to find potential biomarkers of food intake (BFIs). The aim of the present review is to systematically survey the global literature on herbs and spices in an effort to identify and evaluate specific intake biomarkers for a representative set of common herbs and spices in humans. A total of 25 herbs and spices were initially chosen, including anise, basil, black pepper, caraway, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, curcumin, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, lemongrass, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, peppermint and spearmint, rosemary, saffron, sage, tarragon, and thyme. However, only 17 of these herbs and spices had published, peer-reviewed studies describing potential biomarkers of intake. In many studies, the herb or spice of interest was administrated in the form of a capsule or extract and very few studies were performed with actual foods. A systematic assessment of the candidate biomarkers was also performed. Given the limitations in the experimental designs for many of the published studies, further work is needed to better evaluate the identified set of BFIs. Although the daily intake of herbs and spices is very low compared to most other foods, this important set of food seasoning agents should not be underestimated, especially given their potential benefits to human health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Vázquez-Fresno","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Rosana","given":"Albert Remus R."},{"family":"Sajed","given":"Tanvir"},{"family":"Onookome-Okome","given":"Tuviere"},{"family":"Wishart","given":"Noah A."},{"family":"Wishart","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"vazquez-fresno_herbs_2019","container-title":"Genes & Nutrition","container-title-short":"Genes Nutr","DOI":"10.1186/s12263-019-0636-8","ISSN":"1555-8932, 1865-3499","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Herbs and Spices- Biomarkers of Intake Based on Human Intervention Studies – A Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12263-019-0636-8","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"vignini_general_2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between taste identification ability and body mass index (BMI) by studying the response to the administration of different taste stimuli to both sides of the tongue in three different groups of subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy normal-weight volunteers, 19 healthy overweight subjects, and 22 obese subjects were enrolled. For each subject, the lateralization Oldfield score, body weight, height, and blood pressure were determined. The taste test is based on filter paper strips soaked with 4 taste stimuli presented at different concentrations to evoke 4 basic taste qualities (salty, sour, sweet, and bitter); pure rapeseed oil and water were also administered to evoke fat and neutral taste qualities. The stimuli were applied to each side of the protruded tongue. Subjects were asked to identify the taste from a list of eight descriptions according to a multiple choice paradigm. RESULTS: The results showed a general lowering of taste sensitivity with the increase of BMI, except for the taste of fat with rapeseed oil as the stimulus. Other variables affecting taste sensitivity are age (negative association), gender (women generally show higher sensitivity), and taste stimuli concentration (positive association). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could provide important insights into how new therapies could be designed for weight loss and long-term weight maintenance and how diets could be planned combining the correct caloric and nutritional supply with individual taste preferences.","author":[{"family":"Vignini","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Borroni","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Sabbatinelli","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Pugnaloni","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Alia","given":"Sonila"},{"family":"Taus","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Ferrante","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Mazzanti","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Fabri","given":"Mara"}],"citation-key":"vignini_general_2019","container-title":"Disease markers","DOI":"10.1155/2019/2978026","ISSN":"1875-8630 0278-0240","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"2978026-2978026","title":"General Decrease of Taste Sensitivity Is Related to Increase of BMI: A Simple Method to Monitor Eating Behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31089392 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476129/","volume":"2019"},

The work is part of the ongoing LandLex initiative, originally developed as part of the COST ENeL - European Network for e-Lexicography - action. The group brings together researchers in lexicography and lexicologyfrom across Europe and is dedicated to studying multilingual and diachronic issues in language.

After an overwiew of some historically and linguistically relevant factors, a systematisation of Serbian Grecisms is presented—and illustrated with selected examples. This is based on chronological stratification and formal criteria related to both registers, literary and vernacular (with a special stress on the most significant, medieval period), as well as geographic and genetic classifications of Serbian Grecisms. Finally, the complexity of the factors involved in this analysis is illustrated with some formal and/or semantic doublets originating from various periods and directions of borrowing Greek words into Serbian.","author":[{"family":"Vlajić-Popović","given":"Jasna"}],"citation-key":"vlajic-popovic_serbian_","language":"en","page":"22","source":"Zotero","title":"Serbian and Greek: A Long History of Lexical Borrowing","type":"article-journal"},

But how new were the changes described in Reid's Age of Commerce? This paper argues that the four centuries from circa 900 to 1300 CE can be seen as an 'Early Age of Commerce' in Southeast Asia. During this period, a number of commercial and financial changes in China, South Asia, the Middle East and within the Southeast Asian region, greatly promoted maritime trade, which induced the emergence of new ports and urban centres, the movement of administrative capitals toward the coast, population expansion, increased maritime links between societies, the expansion of Theravada Buddhism and Islam, increased monetisation, new industries, new forms of consumption and new mercantile organisations. It is thus proposed that the period from 900 to 1300 be considered the Early Age of Commerce in Southeast Asian history.]","author":[{"family":"Wade","given":"Geoff"}],"citation-key":"wade_early_2009","container-title":"Journal of Southeast Asian Studies","ISSN":"00224634, 14740680","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"221-265","title":"An Early Age of Commerce in Southeast Asia, 900-1300 CE","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/27751563","volume":"40"},

Born in fourteenth-century Morocco, and a contemporary of Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta has left us an account in his own words of his remarkable journeys throughout the Islamic world and beyond: journeys punctuated by adventure and peril, and stretching from his home in Tangier to Zaitun in faraway China.Whether sojourning in Delhi and the Maldives, wandering through the mazy streets of Cairo and Damascus, or contesting with pirates and shipwreck, the indefatigable Ibn Battuta brings to vivid life a medieval world brimming with marvel and mystery. Carefully observing the great diversity of civilizations that he encountered, Ibn Battuta exhibits an omnivorous interest in such matters as food and drink, religious differences (among Christians, Hindus and Shia Muslims), ideas about purity and impurity, disease, women and sex. Recounting the many miracles that its author claims to have experienced personally, his al-rihla or 'Travelogue' is a fascinating mosaic of mysticism and reportage offering a prototype magic realism. David Waines discusses the subtleties of the al-rihla, revealing all the wonders of Ibn Battuta's world to the modern reader. This is a gripping treatment of the life and times of one of history's most daring, and at the same time most human, discoverers.","author":[{"family":"Waines","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"waines_odyssey_2010","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978 1 84511 805 1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"publisher":"I.

(Chinese star anise) has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine and food industry with the actions of dispelling cold, regulating the flow of Qi and relieving pain. Materials and methods A bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing recognized books including Chinese herbal classic, and worldwide accepted scientific databases (Pubmed, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched for the available information on I. verum. Results I. verum is an aromatic evergreen tree of the family Illiciaceae. It is sometimes contaminated with highly toxic Japanese star anise (I. anisatum L.) and poisonous star anise (I. lanceolatum A. C. Smith), which contain several neurotoxic sesquiterpenes. Traditional uses of I. verum are recorded throughout Asia and Northern America, where it has been used for more than 10 types of disorders. Numerous compounds including volatiles, seco-prezizaane-type sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, lignans, flavonoids and other constituents have been identified from I. verum. Modern pharmacology studies demonstrated that its crude extracts and active compounds possess wide pharmacological actions, especially in antimicrobial, antioxidant, insecticidal, analgesic, sedative and convulsive activities. In addition, it is the major source of shikimic acid, a primary ingredient in the antiflu drug (Tamiflu).

  {"id":"wang_relaxation_2004","abstract":"Bitter taste perception prevents mammals from ingesting poisonous substances because many toxins taste bitter and cause aversion. We hypothesize that human bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) genes might be relaxed from selective constraints because of the change in diet, use of fire and reliance on other means of toxin avoidance that emerged in human evolution. Here, we examine the intra-specific variations of all 25 genes of the human TAS2R repertoire. Our data show hallmarks of neutral evolution, including similar rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) nucleotide changes among rare polymorphisms, common polymorphisms and substitutions; no variation in dN/dS among functional domains; segregation of pseudogene alleles within species and fixation of loss-of-function mutations. These results, together with previous findings of large numbers of loss-of-function mutations in olfactory, pheromonal and visual sensory genes in humans, suggest surprisingly reduced sensory capabilities of humans in comparison with many other mammals.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoxia"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Stephanie D."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianzhi"}],"citation-key":"wang_relaxation_2004","container-title":"Human Molecular Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/hmg/ddh289","ISSN":"0964-6906","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"2671-2678","title":"Relaxation of Selective Constraint and Loss of Function in the Evolution of Human Bitter Taste Receptor Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddh289","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"wang_sound_2017","abstract":"Rigorous sound correspondence is fundamental to historical linguistics. It serves as a solid start in studying genetic relationship. Regarding the genetic position of Miao-Yao languages, Li (1937) proposed a hypothesis that the SinoTibetan language family consists of Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Kam-Tai, and Miao-Yao. Benedict (1942; 1975) excluded Miao-Yao from the Sino-Tibetan language family since sound correspondences between Miao-Yao and Chinese were considered to be caused by language contact. The key point in this debate has been ignored for a long time: are the related morphemes proposed in this debate supported by rigorous sound correspondence? In this paper, related morphemes across 11 Miao-Yao languages have been first identified under the requirement of complete sound correspondence, and then analyzed by the Rank Method. The result of the genetic relationship between the 11 Miao-Yao languages has been confirmed. The same procedure has been applied to Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes, and similar pattern has been found. The Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes were recognized to be inherited from the common ancestor of Chinese and Miao-Yao. Combined with the result from the perspective of pervasive sound correspondence (Wang 2015), the proposal of a genetic relationship between Chinese and MiaoYao has been supported. The Inexplicability Principle has been used to weaken the possibility of Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes being induced by borrowing from Chinese to Miao-Yao, since some sound correspondences are unlikely to be explained by natural phonetic mechanisms. Moreover, related morphemes in Chinese and Miao-Yao have been examined from the perspective of Old Chinese, and such an examination also supports the hypothesis of a genetic relationship between Chinese and Miao-Yao languages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wen"}],"citation-key":"wang_sound_2017","container-title":"Bulletin of Chinese Linguistics","contributor":[{"literal":"汪鋒"},{"literal":"劉文"}],"DOI":"10.1163/2405478X-01001006","ISSN":"1933-6985, 2405-478X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"95-119","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sound Correspondence and the Comparative Study of Miao-Yao Languages (語音對應與苗瑤語比較研究): From the Perspective of Complete Sound Correspondence (從完全對應的角度看)","title-short":"Sound Correspondence and the Comparative Study of Miao-Yao Languages (語音對應與苗瑤語比較研究)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bcl/10/1/article-p95_95.xml","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"wang_traditional_2018","abstract":"Ever since the days of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, as a result of the cultural interaction between China and Southeast Asia, the urban morphological evolution of port cities in these regions has always been relatively diverse and inclusive. This paper considers two typical traditional port cities, Quanzhou and Malacca, as research objects, analysing and comparing their morphological characteristics from the different urban evolutionary periods. Due to the morphological analysis, two categories of urban mechanisms that promote the urban evolution of port cities in different historical periods including both the local and the foreign influencing mechanisms can be summarised and scrutinised deeply. This paper concludes that Quanzhou and Malacca represent two important urban evolutionary modes on the Maritime Silk Road, the self- assimilation mode and the transplantation mode.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Han"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Guang"}],"citation-key":"wang_traditional_2018","container-title":"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology","DOI":"10.18517/ijaseit.8.2.4125","ISSN":"2460-6952, 2088-5334","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,31]]},"language":"en","page":"508","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Traditional Urban Form and Evolutionary Mechanisms - Quanzhou and Malacca","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ijaseit.insightsociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=1&article_id=4125","volume":"8"},

As the material carrier of Buddhist culture, Buddhist temples play an important role in preserving regional biodiversity. In this study, we cataloged the tree species in 191 temples across China. Then, we analyzed the species composition, geographical distribution pattern, and the impact factors of Buddhist tree species distribution in different regions to clarify the role of temples in biodiversity conservation. The results showed that: (1) From across 191 temples, we observed a total of 1,059 tree species, belonging to 116 families and 410 genera with most species (n = 773) occurred in only one or two temples. (2) Temple gardens were rich in native and threatened tree species (n = 94), and thus, are of high biodiversity conservation value. (3) The tree species composition of Buddhist temples in different climatic zones was quite different. (4) Tree species across temples had a distinct replacement phenomenon where original Buddhist tree species were gradually replaced by native species similar to the native flora, from south to north. The above results suggest that Chinese temples have very rich plant resource and that their effective protection may play a positive role in maintaining regional biodiversity and improving urban greening.","archive_location":"http://www.biodiversity-science.net","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xinyang"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lihua"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Mingming"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Shenhua"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yongchuan"}],"citation-key":"wang_zhongguofojiaosimiaozhiwuduoyangxinghefojiaoshuzhongtidai_2020","container-title":"Biodiversity Science","DOI":"10.17520/biods.2019392","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"note":"Note: In Chinese with English abstract","page":"668-677","title":"中國佛教寺廟植物多樣性和佛教樹種替代 [Plant Diversity and Species Replacement in Chinese Buddhist Temples]","title-short":"中国佛教寺庙植物多样性和佛教树种替代","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Al-Quran is one of the best reference book, describing the importance of plants, especially herbs in different Surahs for their diverse uses.

Today herbal products symbolise safety in contrast to the synthetics that are regarded as unsafe to human and environment, and people are returning to the naturals with hope of safety and security. Herbs are staging a comeback and herbal ‘renaissance’ is happening all over the globe.

In the process it addresses questions of Nyai Roro Kidul's sexuality and her mythological roots in South, Southeast, and East Asia, as well as her function, with that of the ruler, of maintaining the fertility and thus the welfare of the realm. Her origin as a West Javanese princess embodies the spiritual essence of both the Javanese ruler and his realm, since Nyai Roro Kidul, being part of the ruler's female ancestral line, is the source of life and prosperity for him and thus also for his subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wessing","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"wessing_princess_1997","container-title":"Asian Folklore Studies","container-title-short":"Asian Folklore Studies","DOI":"10.2307/1178730","ISSN":"03852342","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"language":"en","page":"317","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Princess from Sunda: Some Aspects of Nyai Roro Kidul","title-short":"A Princess from Sunda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1178730?origin=crossref","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"wetters_kong_","abstract":"Cantonese in Hong Kong occupies a specific cultural and political niche, informed by the unique context of the Hong Kong identity. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, protesters used modified Cantonese online to evade detection and cement their identity as Hong Kongers. One way in which this was achieved is through a new online vernacular, dubbed “Kong girl phonetics” Kong nui ping jam. This vernacular borrows from grassroots romanization, English phonetics, number substitutions, and bilingualism in English and Cantonese to exclude all readers except young Hong Kong people, who show high bilingualism and high tech literacy and share the vocabulary of protesters. This essay explores aspects of this protest vernacular through non-comprehensive analysis of a thread on LIHKG (Lineage: Hong Kong Golden) lin dang 連黨 that is the first recorded example of “Kong girl speech.” Aspects of Kong nui ping jam identified here are: use of both Cantonese and English vocabulary, use of protest-specific vocabulary, loose romanization that does not correlate to any existing system, textspeak such as abbreviations, and number substitutions borrowed from both English and Cantonese. As well as Kong nui ping jam, another online vernacular is “Kongish,” most visible on the “Kongish Daily” Facebook page, which has a mostly English vocabulary but borrows ending particles, difficult-totranslate vocabulary, and grammar structures from Cantonese, so that the sentence is legible in English but recognizably Cantonese in origin.","author":[{"family":"Wetters","given":"Ruth"}],"citation-key":"wetters_kong_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Kong Girl Phonetics: Loose Cantonese Romanization in the 2019 Hong Kong Protest Movement","type":"article-journal"},

The amount of data, which is unparalleled in previous, related studies, allows us to provide more solid estimates and accounts for the interrelationships between word length, phoneme segment inventory size, and population size than was previously possible.

  {"id":"wierzbicka_thou_","abstract":"This paper argues that “YOU” and “I” (“I” and “THOU”) are fundamental elements of human thought, present as distinct words (or signs) in all human languages. I first developed this thesis in my 1976 article “In defense of YOU and ME” (and before that, introduced it in my 1972 book Semantic Primitives; cf. also my 2021 article “‘Semantic Primitives’, fifty years later”). Since then, it has been confirmed by wide-ranging cross-linguistic investigations conducted in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) framework. But neither the truth of this thesis nor its importance have become widely recognised in linguistics or anthropology. Influential scholars in both these fields continue to undermine the notion of the fundamental unity of humankind and to put total emphasis, instead, on the diversity of languages and cultures. As cross-linguistic investigations of the last fifty years show, however, despite the phenomenal diversity of human languages a shared “alphabet of human thoughts” was not just a figment of Leibniz’s imagination but a fitting metaphor for something real and immeasurably important. As the present article aims to show, “YOU” and “I” (“I” and “THOU”) are two twin cornerstones of this reality. To quote the entry on “Psychic unity of humankind” in the Encyclopedia of Anthropology, “Ineluctably, the idea [of a deep psychological unity of humankind] has ethical significance. For attempting to inform humans about what they are and what they have in common is not a neutral act” (Prono 2006). As the present article seeks to demonstrate (and as Martin Buber compellingly affirmed a century ago), “I” and “THOU” are an ineluctable part of who we are: how we think, how we speak and how we relate to others.","author":[{"family":"Wierzbicka","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"wierzbicka_thou_","container-title":".

  {"id":"wikipedia_spice_2022","abstract":"A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production. For example, vanilla is commonly used as an ingredient in fragrance manufacturing.A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.\nAlthough health benefits are often claimed for spices, there is not currently not enough research conducted to prove these benefits.India contributes to 75% of global spice production. This is reflected culturally through their cuisine; historically, the spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as in East Asia and the Middle East. Europe's demand for spices was among the economic and cultural factors that encouraged exploration in the early modern period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wikipedia","given":"Editors Of The"}],"citation-key":"wikipedia_spice_2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"note: Page Version ID: 1105333543","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Spice","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spice&oldid=1105333543"},

  {"id":"williams_exploring_2016","abstract":"It is well known that nutritional intake can vary substantially as a function of demographic variables such as ethnicity and/or sex. Although a variety of factors are known to underlie the relationship between these demographic variables and nutritional intake, it is interesting to speculate that variation in food intake associated with ethnicity or sex may result, in part, from differences in the perceived taste of foods in these different populations. Thus, we initiated a study to evaluate taste responsiveness in different ethnic groups. Moreover, because of the known differences in taste responsiveness between males and females, analyses were stratified by sex. The ethnic groups tested differed significantly from one another in reported perceived taste intensity. Our results showed that Hispanics and African Americans rated taste sensations higher than non-Hispanic Whites and that these differences were more pronounced in males. Understanding the nature of these differences in taste perception is important, because taste perception may contribute to dietary health risk. When attempting to modify diet, individuals of different ethnicities may require personalized interventions that take into account the different sensory experience that these individuals may have when consuming foods.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Johnny A."},{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Fillingim","given":"Roger B."},{"family":"Dotson","given":"Cedrick D."}],"citation-key":"williams_exploring_2016","container-title":"Chemical Senses","DOI":"10.1093/chemse/bjw021","ISSN":"0379-864X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"449-456","title":"Exploring Ethnic Differences in Taste Perception","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjw021","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"williams_tequila_2015","abstract":"With its unique aroma and heady buzz -- the perfect accompaniment to even the spiciest tacos -- tequila has won its way into drinkers' hearts worldwide. There are few places on earth besides Mexico that have the climate and terrain to evolve the agave plant that makes tequila -- and there are even fewer people who have the patience to wait the seven years or more that it takes \"the tree of marvels\" to grow. In this book, Ian Williams presents a lively history of this potent and popular drink. Beginning with pulque, the drink fermented by the Mayans, Olmecs, and Aztecs and reserved for pregnant women and priests -- and their sacrifices -- he traces how the Mexicans distilled tequila and mezcal (mescal) and began its heady surge into global popularity. From twenty-year a??ejos to giggle-inducing margaritas to the bravado -- and regret -- of that round of shots, he offers a history as gripping as the drink itself. Williams visits countless tequila producers, distributors, and connoisseurs to tell the story of how tequila started in the agave lands of Mexico, became an icon of youthful inebriation, and developed, today, into a truly artisanal product drawing the most discerning drinkers. Peppered throughout are illustrations that capture tequila's Mexican heritage and commercial image. Including recipes for tequila-based cocktails, as well as advice on the buying, storing, tasting, and serving of tequila, this history will delight any beverage aficionado or anyone interested in the history of Mexico and its culinary riches.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"williams_tequila_2015","collection-title":"Edible","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78023-480-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"Tequila: A Global History","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wilson_swindled_2008","abstract":"From the Publisher: Bad food has a history. Swindled tells it. Through a fascinating mixture of cultural and scientific history, food politics, and culinary detective work, Bee Wilson uncovers the many ways swindlers have cheapened, falsified, and even poisoned our food throughout history. In the hands of people and corporations who have prized profits above the health of consumers, food and drink have been tampered with in often horrifying ways-padded, diluted, contaminated, substituted, mislabeled, misnamed, or otherwise faked. Swindled gives a panoramic view of this history, from the leaded wine of the ancient Romans to today's food frauds-such as fake organics and the scandal of Chinese babies being fed bogus milk powder. Wilson pays special attention to nineteenth-and twentieth-century America and England and their roles in developing both industrial-scale food adulteration and the scientific ability to combat it. As Swindled reveals, modern science has both helped and hindered food fraudsters-increasing the sophistication of scams but also the means to detect them. The big breakthrough came in Victorian England when a scientist first put food under the microscope and found that much of what was sold as genuine coffee was anything but-and that you couldn't buy pure mustard in all of London. Arguing that industrialization, laissez-faire politics, and globalization have all hurt the quality of food, but also that food swindlers have always been helped by consumer ignorance, Swindled ultimately calls for both governments and individuals to be more vigilant. In fact, Wilson suggests, one of our best protections is simply to reeducate ourselves about the joys of food and cooking","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Bee"}],"citation-key":"wilson_swindled_2008","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-13820-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","title":"Swindled: The Dark History of Food Fraud, From Poisoned Candy to Counterfeit Coffee","title-short":"Swindled","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wright_medieval_2007","abstract":"The medieval spice trade between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries made Europe wealthy. Black pepper was the most important spice in this trade, and if it was most important because of its piquancy, and the evidence indicates as much, then the discovery of the chile (Capsicum annuum and spp.) would have been an ideal substitute for expensive spices from the East. The medieval spice did in fact decline dramatically about the same time as the discovery and diffusion of the chile. The question arises: did the arrival of the chile in the Old World contribute to or cause the decline in the spice trade? By reviewing the spice trade before the discovery of the New World, the Venetian-Mamluke monopoly on that trade, the role of the Portuguese and Dutch in the spice trade, and the European diffusion of the chile after 1492 this article will argue that the chile played no role in the diminishing of the spice trade and that the chile's arrival in Europe and the decline of the East-West spice trade appear to be coincidental and not causal.","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Clifford A."}],"citation-key":"wright_medieval_2007","container-title":"Gastronomica","DOI":"10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.35","ISSN":"1529-3262","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"35-43","title":"The Medieval Spice Trade and the Diffusion of the Chile","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.35","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"wu_computerassisted_2020","abstract":"Historical language comparison opens windows onto a human past, long before the availability of written records. Since traditional language comparison within the framework of the comparative method is largely based on manual data comparison, requiring the meticulous sifting through dictionaries, word lists, and grammars, the framework is difficult to apply, especially in times where more and more data have become available in digital form. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply automate the process of historical language comparison, not only because computational solutions lag behind human judgments in historical linguistics, but also because they lack the flexibility that would allow them to integrate various types of information from various kinds of sources. A more promising approach is to integrate computational and classical approaches within a 'computer-assisted framework', “neither completely computer-driven nor ignorant of the assistance computers afford” [1, p. 4]. In this paper, we will illustrate what we consider the current state of the art of computer-assisted language comparison by presenting a workflow that starts with raw data and leads up to a stage where sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages have been identified and can be readily presented, inspected, and discussed.

  {"id":"wu_early_2020","abstract":"English vocabulary has expanded over centuries by ‘borrowing’ lexical items from other languages (Katamba, 2005; Durkin, 2014). Compared with European languages, non-European languages are never major sources of word borrowing in English, with Chinese staying even more peripheral. Scholars have recorded no more than a few hundred English words of Chinese origin. This, however, does not make it easier to study the etymology and semantics of Chinese loanwords. The complication arises from the various source dialects from which Chinese words were borrowed (Mandarin, Cantonese, Amoy, Hokkien, etc.) and also from transcription processes, in which Chinese logograms are ‘romanised’ into phonetic representations so as to be readable for English speakers. It is a procedure easily affected by the transcribers' own cognition and the transcription systems employed, and the arbitrariness of the above variables contributes much to the fact that the orthography of Chinese loanwords, especially those entering the English language early, are prone to changes. This article aims to shed some light on how the ways of transcription may affect the spelling of Chinese loanwords.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhen"}],"citation-key":"wu_early_2020","container-title":"English Today","DOI":"10.1017/S0266078419000208","ISSN":"0266-0784","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"23-29","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Early Mandarin Loanwords in Contemporary English: The Influence of Transcription Systems on Orthography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/early-mandarin-loanwords-in-contemporary-english/DED6DECEB487E38C2825ADB31ADEB79C","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"wu_google_2016","abstract":"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words. These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the ﬁnal translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the ﬂexibility of “character”-delimited models and the eﬃciency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores, we consider reﬁning the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement in the BLEU scores did not reﬂect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yonghui"},{"family":"Schuster","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhifeng"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc V."},{"family":"Norouzi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Macherey","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Krikun","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Macherey","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Klingner","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Apurva"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Melvin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaobing"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Gouws","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Yoshikiyo"},{"family":"Kudo","given":"Taku"},{"family":"Kazawa","given":"Hideto"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Kurian","given":"George"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Nishant"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Young","given":"Cliff"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Riesa","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Rudnick","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Vinyals","given":"Oriol"},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Macduff"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"wu_google_2016","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1609.08144","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,8]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:1609.08144","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation","title-short":"Google's Neural Machine Translation System","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144"},

  {"id":"xiang_chemical_2016","abstract":"Szechuan peppers, famous for their unique sensation and ﬂavor, are widely used as a food additive and traditional herbal medicine. Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Z. armatum are both commonly recognized as Szechuan peppers, but they have different tastes and effects. The chemical components, genetic characteristics, and suitable habitat of six cultivars were analyzed in this study. The results indicated that Z. armatum contained a larger proportion of volatile oil, whereas Z. bungeanum produced a more non-volatile ether extraction. The average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. armatum were 11.84 and 11.63%, respectively, and the average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. bungeanum were 6.46 and 14.23%, respectively. Combined with an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence characters and chemical PCA results, six cultivars were classiﬁed into their own groups, for the two species in particular. The temperature in January and July were the most signiﬁcant ecological factors inﬂuencing the contents of the Z. armatum volatile oil. However, annual precipitation, temperature in January and relevant humidity had a signiﬁcant positive correlation with the content of non-volatile ether extract in Z. bungeanum. Thus, the most suitable areas for producing Z. bungeanum cultivars ranged from the Hengduan Mountains to the Ta-pa Mountains, and the regions suitable for Z. armatum cultivars were found to be in the Sichuan Basin and Dalou-Wu mountains. The predicted suitable habitat could be used as a preliminary test area for Szechuan pepper cultivar production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Caixiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiwen"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yadong"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shilin"}],"citation-key":"xiang_chemical_2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"xie_perceiving_2020","abstract":"This paper analyses the ancient Maritime Silk Road through a relational island studies approach. Island ports and island cities represented key sites of water-facilitated transport and exchange in the ancient Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Building our analysis upon a historical overview of the ancient Maritime Silk Road from the perspective of China’s Guangdong Province and the city of Guangzhou, we envision a millennia-long ‘Silk Road Archipelago’ encompassing island cities and island territories stretching across East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and East Africa. Bearing in mind the complex movements of peoples, places, and processes involved, we conceptualise the ancient Maritime Silk Road as an uncentred network of archipelagic relation. This conceptualisation of the ancient Maritime Silk Road as a vast archipelago can have relevance for our understanding of China’s present-day promotion of a 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. We ultimately argue against forcing the Maritime Silk Road concept within a binary perspective of essentialised East-West conflict or hierarchical relations and instead argue for the value of a nuanced understanding of relationality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Baoxia"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xianlong"},{"family":"Grydehøj","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"xie_perceiving_2020","container-title":"Island Studies Journal","container-title-short":"ISJ","DOI":"10.24043/isj.118","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"55-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceiving the Silk Road Archipelago: Archipelagic relations within the ancient and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road","title-short":"Perceiving the Silk Road Archipelago","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://islandstudiesjournal.org/files/ISJXieArchipelagoRelationalitySilkRoad.pdf","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"xiong_being_2015","abstract":"This paper examines both synaesthetic and conceptual metaphors of BITTERNESS and PAIN in Chinese and English. In terms of synaesthetic metaphor, BITTERNESS is more versatile than PAIN, as the former can be transferred to more sensory domains than the latter. Regardless of the sensory domains, the synaesthetic metaphor basically inherits the negative polarity in both Chinese and English. Regarding conceptual metaphor, both BITTERNESS and PAIN exhibit noticeable cross-linguistic differences. Specifically, EFFORT IS BITTERNESS and INTENSITY IS PAIN are attested in Chinese, while EFFORT IS PAIN and INTENSITY IS BITTERNESS are in operation in English. Whenever EFFORT is targeted, the expression at issue obliterates the negative sense of BITTER and PAIN, probably because the concept of “effort” is cross-culturally positive.","author":[{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jiajuan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"xiong_being_2015","container-title":"Chinese Lexical Semantics CLSW 2015: Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 9332","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-27194-1_2","editor":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Helena Hong"}],"ISBN":"978-3-319-27194-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"15-23","publisher":"Springer, Cham","title":"Being Assiduous: Do We Have BITTERNESS or PAIN?","type":"Conference Proceedings"},

  {"id":"yan_zhongguogudaizhiwuxiangliaoshengchan_2008","abstract":"我国是一个历史悠久的文明古国,文化遗产积淀丰厚,香文化源远流长,在香料生产与利用方面积累了大量的技术经验,香料贸易则是我国古代朝贡贸易的重要组成部分,对当时的社会生活产生了深远影响。传统香料按来源划分,可分为动物香料和植物香料,动物香料只有麝香（Musk）、灵猫香（civet）、海狸香（Castoreum）、龙涎香（Ambergris）四种,而植物香料到目前为止被发现的有五百种左右。植物香料在人们起居生活中无所不在,其气味芳香、性质独特,在薰香、美容化妆、饮食调味、医药保健、宗教祭祀等方面应用广泛,作用无可替代。但迄今为止,相关的专题研究非常稀少,研究成果寥若晨星。中国古代植物香料的生产、利用与贸易问题值得全面探讨和深入研究。本论文首先对中国古代主要香料植物的种类、性状和地理分布进行简要介绍。这些最常见的香料植物主要有沉香、乳香、檀香、松香、甘草、白芷、豆蔻、胡椒、花椒、藿香、薄荷、排草香、薰衣草、茉莉、玫瑰、姜、韭、葱、蒜等。芳香植物按其取材部位,可分为树脂类、芳香花草类、香材类、果类和根茎类香料;按其功用,可分为香辛蔬菜与调味类、药用保健类和香化环境类;按其产地,可分为本土香料植物和外来香料植物;按其加工后的形态,又可分为原态香材、线香、篾香、盘香、香丸、香粉、香膏、香汤、香脑油等。不同香料植物的性状各不相同,地理分布也存在明显的地域差异,本文在对其进行简要介绍的同时,为了更清晰展示其全貌,将全国分为华东、华南、华北、西南、西北、东北等六个地区,利用图表形式展示古代文献中有关香料植物的性状和地理分布的原始记录。中国古代植物香料的栽培、加工和贮藏历史悠久。本论文主要从中国古代的农业技术角度,探讨香辛蔬菜、调味料和薰香料等芳香植物的栽培方法。早在《诗经》时代,人们就已经掌握了一些野生香辛植物引进园圃进行栽培和改良的相关技术,培育出葱、姜、蒜、韭、薤、桂、椒、蒿、芷、香橼等多种本土香料。其栽培方法主要有选种、下种、移植、压条、扦插,详细说明古人在生产生活实践中,栽培香辛蔬菜和调味料技术已呈现多样化趋势。同时,他们也懂得将茉莉、排草香、水仙、柑橘、土沉香等薰香料类芳香植物的越冬防寒技术,其主要有室内盆栽保暖和以土培根等。总的来说,我国古代香料植物的人工栽培规模大小不一,以小规模的园圃形式为主。另外,土沉香是古代中国特有的树脂类薰香料,因其自然资源稀少,且只能在气候温暖湿润的岭南一些地区的沙质土壤中生长,所以,只有依靠人工栽培才能满足需求,但栽培环境要求严格,所以文中对其人工栽培问题还特书一笔。栽培并出售香料植物获得经济来源是一些古人的谋生手段之一,虽然在不同的历史时期和地域,这一谋生手段的地位和作用存在差别,但本文对这一问题也给予了简要的论述,在于强调我国古代百姓贾农,为了谋生而从事植物香料生产经营的经济目的。先人们在植物香料的加工、贮藏方面手段多样,并积累了丰富的经验,且相关技术日趋成熟,值得我们研究和借鉴。总体上讲,我国古代植物香料的加工炮制方法主要有水制、火制和水火合制三种。其中,水制又可分为洗、漂、泡、渍、水飞等;火制包括煅、炮、煨、炒、烘、焙、炙等;水火合制主要有蒸、煮、淬等。在古代中国,植物香料的贮藏方法多种多样,可谓举不胜举。限于论文篇幅,本研究只对龙脑香、柑橘、姜等几种薰香料、香果与香蔬的贮藏方法作重点介绍,并着重对其保鲜防腐、防治蠹虫、防止香味散失等加工、贮藏技术进行梳理。最后交待了中国古代宫廷与民间制香的发展历程。中国古代植物香料的利用历时悠远,途径多种,影响深远,意义重大。有关这一问题,本文着重探讨以下几个方面的问题:植物香料与中国古代的薰香、美容、饮食、医疗、保健和宗教祭祀。在薰香生活中,利用植物香料制作的薰香料扮演着举足轻重的角色,一直受到重视。文中首先追溯了中国古代薰香的历史渊源,接着分别着重叙述了隋、唐、五代、宋、元、明、清时期薰香的发展过程;在此基础上,对我国古代植物香料与传统制香业特别是是宫廷贵族的薰香调配、制作、使用作了概括性介绍,凸现植物香料在宫廷生活中的重要地位。同时,介绍了历代薰香料（合香）的调配与制作技术,利用玉片、银叶、砂片、云母等进行隔火薰香的方法,薰香炉具的品种、款式、质地与使用方法的演变等。中国古代香妆品有着悠久的历史,远在三千多年前的夏、商时期,就有了利用芳香植物美容化妆的文献记载。古代香妆品的主要成份来自于天然香料植物,所以,植物香料与中国古代美容化妆关系密切。针对这一问题,文章首先全面阐述了中国古代香妆品使用的大致发展历程,其结论是:先秦时期粉和胭脂的一般利用,南北朝时期寿阳妆、红妆的出现与流行,隋唐时期化妆技术成熟,盛装和浓妆是这一时期的特点,宋元时期流行淡雅、含蓄面妆,明清时期香精提炼技术成熟,香妆品的品种开始繁多。最后,分别介绍中国古代口脂、面脂、胭脂、香粉、藻豆、香泽、香露和眉黛等各种香妆品的使用与制作,从美白、去斑、去皱、润肤等角度,专门探讨独具特色的中国古代医学芳香美容,为我国现代美容技术的发展提供历史借鉴。植物香料与中国古代饮食、医药、宗教祭祀等活动密不可分,饮食、薰香、化妆、医药、宗教祭祀是植物香料的主要功能。笔者为此着重探讨三个方面的问题:一是植物香料与中国古代饮食之间的关系。主要包括植物香料在烹饪调味、香茶加工利用、香酒加工利用过程中利用;二是植物香料在中国古代医药保健中的作用。上古时期,先民在顺应自然、改造自然的活动中,凭藉观其形、闻其气和尝其味,在长期实践过程中,逐渐认识到自然界中一些芳香植物的医药保健作用,这些具有医药功能的芳香植物也就是香药。香药以其令人愉快的气味被先民所喜欢,又因其独特的药用效果为先民所利用,辛、温、热是古人对香药性质的根本认识。古代医家甚至把香药特别划为一个门类列入其著作当中,成为先民最早认识并广泛用之于临床的中药。本文主要论述了“香药”利用的历史沿革,包括古人对香料植物制作的香药性状的认识、利用和加工炮制,以及香药在医疗保健中的利用等一系列问题;三是植物香料在古代各种形式的祭祀活动中扮演的角色。在宗教中,“香”自古被认为具有通达上天的作用,是神灵的使者。本研究主要探讨了古代祭天祀祖、佛教和道教仪式中植物香料的使用情况。为了寻求政治、军事和贸易保护,古代很多邻邦奉强盛的中国为宗主国,派使者携带香料、象牙等物品来到中国进献给朝廷。有时地方政府为取悦于朝廷也会向朝廷进献特产香料。香料是中国古代域外和各级地方政府的主要朝贡品,在中国古代的朝贡贸易中担当着重要角色,有时甚至起着其它物品不可替代的作用。通过朝贡而来的域外植物香料,扩大了中国古代植物香料的来源,增加了植物香料的品种,对这一问题的探讨,有助于我们进一步了解中国古代植物香料与域外植物香料之间的关系。对各个历史时期地方政府向朝廷进献植物香料行为的研究,也有助于我们扩大了解中国古代本土植物香料的一些情况。为了便于研究中国古代香料的朝贡贸易问题,笔者把中国古代分为五个时段,分别探讨了魏晋南北朝及其以前、隋唐五代、宋元、明、清时期的香料朝贡贸易,分析香料朝贡贸易的原因、实质与作用,研究香料朝贡贸易的影响,尤其注重对宋代、明代和清代的香料朝贡贸易问题进行研究,分析在各自的历史背景下香料朝贡贸易的原因及其对中国古代政治、经济、文化和社会生活等产生的影响。毋庸讳言,尽管在本论文在撰写过程中,笔者广泛地搜集资料,进行了多方位的研究和探讨,由于资料、时间和个人水平等因素,文章存在不足甚至舛误之处在所难免,如对植物香料的种类和地理分布阐述不够系统全面,对植物香料的利用问题探讨有待于深入,对中国古代香料朝贡贸易问题分析还不十分透彻,等等。期望本研究能够弥补学界研究之不足、拓展科技史研究范围,给当今香料、香精、化妆品产业提供历史借鉴和参考,为继承和发展中国古代“香文化遗产”尽绵薄之力。my country is an ancient civilization with a long history, rich in cultural heritage, and a long history of incense culture. It has accumulated a lot of technical experience in the production and utilization of spices. The spice trade is an important part of the ancient tribute trade in my country. had a profound impact. Traditional spices can be divided into animal spices and plant spices according to their sources. Animal spices are only musk (Musk), civet (civet), castoreum (Castoreum), and ambergris (Ambergris). About 500 species have been discovered. Plant spices are ubiquitous in people's daily life, with their aromatic smell and unique properties, they are widely used in aromatherapy, beauty and makeup, food seasoning, medicine and health care, religious sacrifices, etc., and their role is irreplaceable. But so far, the relevant special researches are very rare, and the research results are few and far between. The production, utilization and trade of ancient Chinese plant spices are worthy of comprehensive discussion and in-depth research. This paper first briefly introduces the types, characters and geographical distribution of the main spice plants in ancient China. These most common spice plants mainly include agarwood, frankincense, sandalwood, rosin, licorice, angelica dahurica, cardamom, pepper, pepper, patchouli, mint, herbal incense, lavender, jasmine, rose, ginger, leek, onion, garlic, etc. Aromatic plants can be divided into resins, aromatic flowers and plants, aromatic materials, fruits and rhizome spices according to their parts; according to their functions, they can be divided into spicy vegetables and seasoning, medicinal health care and aroma environment; According to its place of origin, it can be divided into local spice plants and exotic spice plants; according to its processed form, it can be divided into original incense materials, incense sticks, stick incense, coil incense, incense pills, incense powder, balm, incense Soup, peppermint oil, etc. The traits of different spice plants are different, and there are obvious regional differences in geographical distribution. In this paper, while briefly introducing them, in order to show their overall picture more clearly, the whole country is divided into East China, South China, North China, Southwest China, Northwest China and Northeast China. The original records of the traits and geographical distribution of spice plants in ancient literature were displayed in the form of diagrams. The cultivation, processing and storage of ancient Chinese plant spices have a long history. This paper mainly discusses the cultivation methods of aromatic plants such as spicy vegetables, seasonings and incense from the perspective of ancient Chinese agricultural technology. As early as the \"Book of Songs\" era, people have mastered the related technologies of introducing some wild spice plants into gardens for cultivation and improvement, and cultivated onion, ginger, garlic, leek, scallion, osmanthus, pepper, artemisia, zhi, citron, etc. native spices. Its cultivation methods mainly include seed selection, sowing, transplanting, layering, and cuttings. In detail, in the production and life practice of the ancients, the cultivation of spicy vegetables and seasoning techniques has shown a trend of diversification. At the same time, they also know the overwintering and cold protection techniques of aromatic plants such as jasmine, paicaoxiang, narcissus, citrus, and agarwood, which mainly include indoor potted plants to keep warm and soil bacon. Generally speaking, the artificial cultivation scales of spice plants in ancient my country vary, mainly in the form of small-scale gardens. In addition, agarwood is a unique resinous incense in ancient China. Because of the scarcity of natural resources, it can only grow in sandy soil in some areas in the south of the Five Ridges with a warm and humid climate. Therefore, only artificial cultivation can meet the demand, but cultivation The environmental requirements are strict, so there is a special book about its artificial cultivation in this paper. Cultivating and selling spice plants to obtain economic resources is one of the means of livelihood of some ancient people. Although the status and function of this means of livelihood are different in different historical periods and regions, this article also gives a brief discussion on this issue. It is to emphasize the economic purpose of Jia Nong, a common man in ancient my country, engaged in the production and management of plant spices in order to make a living. The ancestors have various methods in the processing and storage of plant spices, and have accumulated rich experience, and the related technologies are becoming more and more mature, which is worthy of our study and reference. Generally speaking, there are three main methods of processing plant spices in ancient my country: water, fire and water-fire combination. Among them, the water system can be divided into washing, bleaching, soaking, soaking, water flying, etc.; the fire system includes calcining, firing, simmering, frying, baking, roasting, broiling, etc.; In ancient China, there were various storage methods for plant spices, which can be described as too numerous to mention. Due to the limited length of the paper, this study only focuses on the storage methods of dipterocarp, citrus, ginger and other spices, fragrant fruits and fragrant vegetables, and focuses on the processing and storage of fresh-keeping and antisepsis, silverfish control, and fragrance loss prevention. technology sorting out. Finally, the development process of ancient Chinese court and folk incense making is explained. The utilization of plant spices in ancient China has a long history and various ways, with far-reaching influence and great significance. Regarding this issue, this article focuses on the following aspects: plant spices and ancient Chinese incense, beauty, diet, medical treatment, health care and religious sacrifices. In the incense life, the incense made of plant spices plays a pivotal role and has always been valued. This article first traces the historical origin of incense in ancient my country, and then focuses on the development process of incense in Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties; The incense industry, especially the incense blending, production and use of the court nobles, is given a general introduction, highlighting the important position of plant spices in court life. At the same time, it introduces the blending and production technology of incense (hexiang) in the past dynasties, the method of using jade flakes, silver leaves, sand flakes, mica, etc. evolution etc. Ancient Chinese fragrances and cosmetics have a long history. As far back as the Xia and Shang dynasties more than 3,000 years ago, there have been records of using aromatic plants for beauty and makeup. The main ingredients of ancient cosmetics come from natural spice plants, so plant spices are closely related to ancient Chinese beauty and makeup. In response to this problem, the article first comprehensively expounds the general development process of the use of ancient Chinese cosmetics. The conclusions are: the general use of powder and rouge in the pre-Qin period, the appearance and popularity of Shouyang makeup and red makeup in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the makeup technology in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Maturity, costumes and heavy makeup are the characteristics of this period. Elegant and subtle facial makeup was popular in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the essence extraction technology was mature, and the varieties of fragrance cosmetics began to increase. Finally, it introduces the use and production of ancient Chinese cosmetics such as lip balm, face balm, rouge, face powder, algae beans, fragrance, fragrance dew and eyebrow cream, from whitening, freckle removal, wrinkle removal, skin moisturizing, etc. From the angle of view, it specifically discusses the unique ancient Chinese medical aroma cosmetology, and provides historical reference for the development of modern cosmetology technology in our country. Plant spices are inseparable from ancient Chinese diet, medicine, religious sacrifices and other activities. Diet, aromatherapy, makeup, medicine, and religious sacrifices are the main functions of plant spices. The author focuses on three aspects: one is the relationship between plant spices and ancient Chinese diet. It mainly includes the use of plant spices in cooking seasoning, processing and utilization of fragrant tea, and processing and utilization of fragrant wine; the second is the role of plant spices in ancient Chinese medicine and health care. In ancient times, in the activities of conforming to and transforming nature, the ancestors gradually realized the medical and health functions of some aromatic plants in nature by observing their shape, smelling their breath and tasting their taste. Functional aromatic plants are also fragrant medicines. Aromatic medicine was liked by the ancestors for its pleasant smell, and was used by the ancestors because of its unique medicinal effect. Pungent, warm and hot are the basic understanding of the properties of fragrant medicine by the ancients. Ancient physicians even classified fragrant medicine as a special category and included it in their works, which became the earliest traditional Chinese medicine recognized by the ancestors and widely used in clinical practice. This paper mainly discusses the historical evolution of the utilization of \"fragrant medicine\", including a series of issues such as the ancients' understanding, utilization and processing of aromatic medicines made from spice plants, and the use of fragrant medicines in medical care; the third is the use of plant spices in The role played in various forms of sacrificial activities in ancient times. In religion, \"fragrance\" has been believed to have the function of reaching the heavens since ancient times, and is the messenger of the gods. This study mainly explores the use of plant spices in ancient rituals of offering sacrifices to heaven and ancestors, Buddhism and Taoism. In order to seek political, military and trade protection, many neighboring countries in ancient times regarded the powerful China as their suzerain, and sent envoys to China with spices, ivory and other items to present to the imperial court. Sometimes local governments will also offer special spices to the imperial court in order to please the imperial court. Spices were the main tribute products of foreign and local governments in ancient China. They played an important role in the tribute trade in ancient China, and sometimes even played an irreplaceable role for other items. The extraterritorial plant spices brought by tribute have expanded the source of ancient Chinese plant spices and increased the variety of plant spices. The discussion of this issue will help us further understand the relationship between ancient Chinese plant spices and extraterritorial plant spices. . The research on the behavior of local governments donating plant spices to the imperial court in various historical periods will also help us to expand our understanding of some of the local plant spices in ancient China. In order to facilitate the study of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China, the author divides ancient China into five periods, respectively discussing the tribute trade of spices in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties and before, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and analyzing the spice tribute trade. The reasons, substance and function of the spice tributary trade are studied, and the influence of the spice tribute trade is studied, especially focusing on the study of the spice tribute trade in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, and the reasons for the spice tribute trade in their respective historical backgrounds and their influence on ancient Chinese politics, economic, cultural and social life. Needless to say, although the author extensively collected materials and conducted multi-faceted research and discussions during the writing process of this paper, due to factors such as data, time and personal level, it is inevitable that the article has deficiencies or even mistakes, such as The types and geographical distribution of plant spices are not described systematically and comprehensively, the utilization of plant spices needs to be further explored, the analysis of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China is not very thorough, and so on. It is hoped that this study can make up for the lack of academic research, expand the scope of research on the history of science and technology, provide historical reference and reference for today's spices, flavors, and cosmetics industries, and contribute to the inheritance and development of ancient Chinese \"fragrance cultural heritage\".","archive":"CNKI","author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Xiaoqing"}],"citation-key":"yan_zhongguogudaizhiwuxiangliaoshengchan_2008","contributor":[{"literal":"严小青"}],"event-place":"Nanjing","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"publisher":"Nanjing Agricultural University","publisher-place":"Nanjing","title":"中国古代植物香料生产、利用与贸易研究 [The Study of Armoatic Plant on Production, Utilization and Trade in Ancient China]","type":"thesis","URL":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CDFD&dbname=CDFDLAST2015&filename=2009076970.nh&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=KWl8ifoJDTjIpdXHuCMxZoOvb5SI4AGjsl4qSkP7QvJTOl6dN--NCfNJod0coioU"},

  {"id":"yaniv_medicinal_2014","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs.

  {"id":"yaqoob_distribution_2016","abstract":"The genus Ferula L. (Apiaceae) from Latin ferula, \"rod\" comprises of 180–185 species of flowering plants distributed in central and south-west Asia, far east, north India and the Mediterranean basin. The species of genus Ferula mostly grows in mountainous regions and some are distributed in arid climates. Various species of Ferula have been reported from USSR, Pakistan, India and western Himalayas. Some species of the genus are commonly used as spices. Some of species of genus Ferula are used in the preparation of local drugs. These plants are also known to be a rich source of gum-resin used in folklore medicine. The genus Ferula is mostly characterized by the presence of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene coumarins. The genus Ferula has long been regarded as a monophyletic genus because its members are similar in habit and morphology but recent molecular studies stated that there is a controversy on both upper and lower level classification of the genus Ferula. The molecular studies concluded that Ferula group including Dorema, Leutea and Ferula is in the tribe Scandiceae, based on ITS sequence analysis. It was found that Dorema and Leutea arise from within a paraphyletic Ferula and suggested nomenclatural changes. This review mainly focuses on the distribution and taxonomy of the medicinally economic important genus Ferula.","author":[{"family":"Yaqoob","given":"Ubaid"},{"family":"Nawchoo","given":"Irshad Ahmad"}],"citation-key":"yaqoob_distribution_2016","container-title":"Journal of Botany","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"Distribution and Taxonomy of Ferula L","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"yingsheng_open_2019","abstract":"The first section of this article begins by investigating the term “going down to the Western Oceans” (xia xiyang 下西洋), which was used as early as the time of Zheng He. It also discusses the origin of the concepts of the Eastern and Western Oceans. The second section discusses the influx of overseas geographical knowledge into China before the time of Zheng He, especially over two important periods: first, the coming of Indian geographical knowledge along with Buddhism to China from the Wei-Jin period (220–420 ce), and second, the advent of Islamic geographical knowledge during the Mongol-Yuan period (ca. 1206–1368). The third section discusses the contributions of foreign members in Zheng He’s fleet, especially fanhuozhang 番火長 (foreign pilot). Through an analysis of the records of three military encounters—the suppression of the pirate Chen Zuyi 陳祖義, the attack on Ceylon, and the battle with pirates on a return journey—we find that the term fanhuozhang appears in all three cases, showing that foreign experts were commonly present in all branches or segments of Zheng He’s fleet, and that it must have been their job to navigate in the Indian ocean portion of the journey. Based on these findings, the author suggests that even before the beginning of Ming, Chinese people had developed an understanding of navigation technology and absorbed expertise from other peoples, and that this knowledge formed the technological foundation of Zheng He’s long-distance voyages, evident of the fact that China’s ancient navigational technology was an open knowledge system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yingsheng","given":"Liu"}],"citation-key":"yingsheng_open_2019","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101003","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"50-91","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Open Knowledge System for Navigational Science: Zheng He’s Maritime Expeditions and Sino-Foreign Overseas Exchange","title-short":"An Open Knowledge System for Navigational Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p50_50.xml","volume":"1"},

Recent lexical borrowing research has drawn attention to this social meaning potential of loanwords. What motivates language users to select a borrowed form over a receptor language equivalent, what is the (perceived) social meaning of this choice and how can we empirically address these questions? This special issue seeks to bring into debate the interface between speakers (the social dimension) and language (the linguistic dimension) with regard to lexical borrowing, and to probe how language regard and speaker identity influence and explain the use of loanwords. In a bid to better understand this complex interface, the special issue includes papers that explore a range of empirical methodologies drawn from different subfields of (socio)linguistics and closely related scientific domains (linguistic anthropology, conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, social psychology and psycholinguistics) and documents a variety of contact situations: English loans into French and Finnish, Māori loanwords into New Zealand English, German loans into Dutch.

Another interesting tendency is the priority of synaesthesia over the embodied metaphor.

Based on this set of less-studied data, we find that Mandarin synesthesia does not share the same directionality tendencies with linguistic synesthesia in Indo-European languages, which challenges the assumed cross-linguistic universality of these transfer patterns. Based on the corpus data, we demonstrate that there are three types of directional tendencies for Mandarin synesthesia: unidirectional, biased-directional, and bidirectional. Unidirectional synesthesia is rule-based, while synesthesia that is biased in one direction is frequency-based. In contrast, bidirectional synesthesia shows no directional preference. Thus, the directionality of linguistic synesthesia cannot be interpreted as rule-based or frequency-based exclusively. In addition, this study finds that linguistic synesthesia shows language-specific variations for directionality tendencies grounded in both embodiment and neural mechanisms, which challenges the theory that linguistic synesthesia is a bio-neurologically based linguistic realization. Lastly, the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves both rule-based and frequency-based transfer directionalities suggests that the relationship between linguistic synesthesia and metaphor merits further exploration.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Ahrens","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"zhao_directionality_2019","container-title":"Lingua","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2019.102744","ISSN":"0024-3841","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"102744","title":"Directionality of Linguistic Synesthesia in Mandarin: A Corpus-based Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384119304930","volume":"232"},

Based on a lexical analysis of Mandarin synesthetic usages, we find that (1) linguistic synesthesia maps the metaphorical meaning between two domains; and (2) linguistic synesthetic mappings and conceptual metaphoric mappings have similar behaviors when sense modalities are treated as conceptual domains that contain a set of mappings constrained by Mapping Principles. This lexical-conceptual account is designed to capture the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves mapping between lexicalized concepts of sensory properties, instead of the real-time sensory input that is processed in neurological synesthesia. The incorporation of a lexical semantic view with the framework of Conceptual Metaphor Theory not only offers a coherent and comprehensive account for the nature of linguistic synesthesia, but also handles aspects of linguistic synesthesia previously only accounted for by nonmetaphorical accounts. These design features make this proposal the most comprehensive account to fit the current data.

  {"id":"zhao_synaesthesia_2018a","abstract":"Linguistic synaesthesia involving description of one sensory modality in terms of concepts from another sensory modality, such as sweet voice and 冷色 leng3 se4 'cold color', is employed across discourse types (i.e., poetic and ordinary), time periods (i.e., synchronic and diachronic), and language families (e.g., Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Semitic). The kind of language use has, however, not received much attention in linguistic research, although manifesting as mapping from one bodily domain to another bodily domain would pose challenges to Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment. This thesis thus aimed to conduct a systematic and comprehensive lexical semantic study on linguistic synaesthesia of Mandarin sensory adjectives from a corpus-based approach, to explore the tendencies of Mandarin synaesthesia, and to examine the theoretical implications of linguistic synaesthesia. This study proposed a linguistic synaesthesia identification procedure (LSIP) to extract synaesthetic data for Mandarin sensory adjectives from the Sinica corpus, which was adapted from Pragglejaz Group (2007)'s well-established metaphor identification procedure (MIP). The proposed identification procedure for linguistic synaesthesia was demonstrated to be also applicable to other languages from other corpora. Based on the distribution of the collected synaesthetic usages of Mandarin sensory adjectives, the study found that Mandarin synaesthesia exhibited directionality mapping from more embodied senses to less embodied ones, analogous to the attested patterns of linguistic synaesthesia in Indo-European, Hebrew, and Indonesian languages. The directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia is, however, tendencies-based. In addition, Mandarin synaesthesia was attested to show language-specific characteristics when compared to the established tendencies of English synaesthesia, hence inconsistent with the proposal of cross-lingual universality of synaesthetic patterns. The distribution and directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia demonstrated that neither the embodiment account nor the biological association account of linguistic synaesthesia could be fully supported. The thesis thus suggested an incorporated theoretical model containing both embodiment mechanisms and biological mechanisms, to account for the synaesthetic tendencies of Mandarin sensory adjectives and the language-specific characteristics of linguistic synaesthesia in Mandarin Chinese. Besides, this study has shown that linguistic synaesthesia is a type of metaphor as a linguistic realization of conceptual metaphors, which should be taken into consideration by Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The thesis therefore argued for a finer-grained account of embodiment covering the notions of the degree of embodiment and the type of embodied events, to refine Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"}],"citation-key":"zhao_synaesthesia_2018a","event-place":"Hong Kong","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Synaesthesia, Metaphor, and Cognition: A Corpus-Based Study on Synaesthetic Adjectives in Mandarin Chinese","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/200/9509"},

  {"id":"zhong_pleasing_2018","abstract":"Description of flavours of desserts often involves a rich range of vocabulary. This paper investigates the real-life language describing tastes of desserts in Mandarin Chinese, extracting data from Dazhong Dianping, the most popular restaurant review website in China. Using the Sketch Engine as the primary tool to extract collocations, we found that ‘mouthfeel’ and ‘personality’, instead of direct descriptions of TASTE or SMELL, are the most dominant expressions. In particular, more than one hundred ‘mouthfeel’ words are identified, with strong tendency of positive polarity. The majority of ‘mouthfeel’ terms are tactile (sense of touch) in nature, which shall be considered as synaesthetic metaphors to depict TASTE. Moreover, these ‘mouthfeel’ words often collocate with words connoting pleasant personality, especially in terms of warm social interactions. In summary, due to its intensional rather than physical telicity, description of desserts shows significant cultural variations. On the one hand, the preferred words still retain the same telic purpose, i.e., to please the mouth; on the other hand, instead of using expressions conveying intensional bodily pleasure (sensuality/sexuality), Chinese focus both on the parochial bodily experience (pleasing the mouth) as well as the social-interactional (pleasant personality) to describe desserts.","author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Yin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"zhong_pleasing_2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the 32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation: 25th Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing","event-place":"Hong Kong","event-title":"32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"page":"893-903","publisher":"ACL","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Pleasing to the Mouth of Pleasant Personality: A Corpus-based Study of Conceptualization of Desserts in Online Chinese Food Reviews","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"zhou_problems_2022","abstract":"Cosine similarity of contextual embeddings is used in many NLP tasks (e.g., QA, IR, MT) and metrics (e.g., BERTScore). Here, we uncover systematic ways in which word similarities estimated by cosine over BERT embeddings are understated and trace this effect to training data frequency. We ﬁnd that relative to human judgements, cosine similarity underestimates the similarity of frequent words with other instances of the same word or other words across contexts, even after controlling for polysemy and other factors. We conjecture that this underestimation of similarity for high frequency words is due to differences in the representational geometry of high and low frequency words and provide a formal argument for the two-dimensional case.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Ethayarajh","given":"Kawin"},{"family":"Card","given":"Dallas"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"zhou_problems_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2205.05092","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Problems with Cosine as a Measure of Embedding Similarity for High Frequency Words","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05092"},

We ﬁnd that countries whose names occur with low frequency in training corpora are more likely to be tokenized into subwords, are less semantically distinct in embedding space, and are less likely to be correctly predicted: e.g., Ghana (the correct answer and invocabulary) is not predicted for, “The country producing the most cocoa is [MASK].”. Although these performance discrepancies and representational harms are due to frequency, we ﬁnd that frequency is highly correlated with a country’s GDP; thus perpetuating historic power and wealth inequalities.

  {"id":"zohar_trends_2013","abstract":"Abstract\n            Perfumes have been known as utilizable but exclusive products since antiquity. Use of aromatic substances was first mentioned in archaic sources of the ancient world. The origin of such fragrant substances was mainly vegetable and animal. Throughout history, the use of subtle perfumes increased and some of the exotic materials became expensive and valuable commodities. They were the source of wealth for cultures and rulers. The contribution of the Arabs to the distribution of new crops, knowledge, industrial techniques and substances is a well-known phenomenon. In our article we intend to focus on the new perfumes that were distributed throughout the world thanks to the Arab conquests and the knowledge of their other uses, mainly medicinal, that was handed down along with the products themselves. About 20 common perfumes are known to have been used in the medieval world, though half of them were not mentioned in earlier sources.\n            These phenomena will be dealt with and presented in a profile we built up for four perfumes: agarwood, camphor, musk and ambergris. The theoretical and practical uses of these perfumes that are presented in detail (based on various sources including traders’ documents, medical literature and practical Genizah fragments, dealing mainly with medicine) will serve as case studies for the understanding of new trends in the uses of perfumes after the Muslim conquest. Arab perfumes can be divided into three groups, according to their level of importance:\n            \n              A.\n              New perfumes, mainly from the vast region named “India”; most of which (such as camphor, ambergris and sandalwood and a compound made out of them known as\n              nadd\n              and\n              ghāliya\n              ) were not known in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region until the Muslim conquests.\n            \n            \n              B.\n              Perfumes that kept their popularity including: a variety of cinnamon, costus, spikenard, frankincense, saffron and rose.\n            \n            \n              C.\n              Perfumes that lost their worth like balsam and myrrh.\n            \n            It seems that camphor was the best and most cherished perfume that substituted balsam. Like balsam, the importance of myrrh that was imported from Arabia and East Africa also declined and it seems that its substitute was musk. Transformations in perfume fashion were in fact only part of a wider revolution of the Arabic material culture which the Middle East, the Mediterranean region and even many European countries experienced due to the Arab conquests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zohar","given":"Amar"},{"family":"Lev","given":"Efraim"}],"citation-key":"zohar_trends_2013","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

  {"id":"zurbuchen_introduction_2020","abstract":"The oldest and most extensive written language of Southeast Asia is Old Javanese, or Kawi. It is the oldest language in terms of written records, and the most extensive in the number and variety of its texts. Javanese literature has taken many forms. At various times, prose stories, sung poetry or other metrical types, chronicles, scientific, legal, and philosophical treatises, prayers, chants, songs, and folklore were all written down. Yet relatively few texts are available in English. The unstudied texts remaining are an unexplored record of Javanese culture as well as a language still alive as a literary medium in Bali. Introduction to Old Javanese Language and Literature represents a first step toward remedying the dearth of Old Javanese texts available to English-speaking students. The ideal teaching companion, this anthology offers transliterated original texts with facing-page English translations. Theanthology focuses on prose selections, since their straightforward style and syntax offer the beginning student the most rewarding experience. Four sections make up the collection. Part I offers several short readings as the most accessible entry point into Old Javanese. Part II contains two moralistic fables from an Old Javanese retelling of the Hindu Pañcatantra cycle. Part III takes up the epic, providing excerpts from one of the books of the Old Javanese retelling of the Mahabharata. Part IV offers excerpts from two chronicles, the generic conventions of which challenge received notions of history writing because of their supernaturalism and folkloric elements. Includes introduction, glossary, and notes.","author":[{"family":"Zurbuchen","given":"Mary S."}],"citation-key":"zurbuchen_introduction_2020","ISBN":"978-0-472-90218-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"University of Michigan Press","title":"Introduction to Old Javanese Language and Literature: A Kawi Prose Anthology","type":"book"}
