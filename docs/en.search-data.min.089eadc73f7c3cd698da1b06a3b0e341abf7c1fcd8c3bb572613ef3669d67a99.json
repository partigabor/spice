As it can be seen above in Spice profile [spice:allspice]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;spice:allspice\u0026rdquo;} presenting allspice, this business-card-like environment gives a quick reference of the spice under scrutiny in a concise way. This is intended to be a convenience for the reader to return and glance back at brief, factual information about a particular item whenever necessary. The box also contains a clickable link to the related plant species in a botanical database, [POWO]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;POWO\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;}, where more information can be found, such as the plants\u0026rsquo; biodiversity, distribution, botanical synonyms, as well as images of specimens. :::\nAllspice, also known as pimento and Jamaica pepper, refers to the dried unripe fruits of a tropical evergreen tree growing in the Caribbean: the . The dried berries are dark brown, hard to the touch, and 4\u0026ndash;6 mm in diameter (thus larger than black pepper). Their signature crown is by a small ring of the calyx [@van_wyk_culinary_2014 210]. It is one of the few spices that do not come from the East; chili, vanilla, and allspice are the traditional three when one is listing spice products native to the Americas (disregarding cacao which is not considered a spice today). It is also the only spice that is exclusively cultivated on the western hemisphere [@duke_crc_2002 21]. The term allspice is a coinage playing on the notion that the flavors and aroma of allspice is similar to that of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper [@mabberley_mabberleys_2017 717]\u0026mdash;the most popular spices in Europe at the time when Europeans got in contact with this New World spice. People who only saw ground allspice but not whole, often tend to think that is in fact a spice mixture, after its name and rich flavor profile. Usually ground to powder, allspice is one of the key ingredients of Caribbean cuisine, especially jerk style dry-rub meat preparation. It is also used in European sausage making, pickling, baking, and flavoring liqueurs, it an overall \u0026ldquo;handy spice\u0026rdquo;.1 It also found its way into some Middle Eastern spice blends.\n::: note []{#note:pimento label=\u0026ldquo;note:pimento\u0026rdquo;} Allspice is sometimes called pimento, which is also the name of a cultivar of , famous from the Southern United States appetizer pimento-cheese. It is therefore important not to confuse allspice with the heart-shaped mild cherry peppers that North Americans also call pimiento or pimento. :::\nThe Botany, Origin, and Cultivation of Allspice\r#\rThe allspice tree is a small mid-canopy tree or shrub with smooth, bay-like leaves and tiny white flowers. The berries turn dark purple if left to ripe, and the leaves and the bark are also aromatic [@riffle_tropical_1998 279]. Belonging to the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), allspice is related to other aromatic trees, such as clove, eucalyptus, and the bay rum tree. Its binomial name is made up of pimenta, the Portuguese (or corrupted Spanish) equivalent of \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo;, and dioica \u0026lsquo;of two houses\u0026rsquo; (Greek di- from dyo \u0026rsquo;two\u0026rsquo; and oikos \u0026lsquo;house\u0026rsquo;), indicating that the male and female flowers are found on different plants [166]peter_handbook_2012.\nAllspice is indigenous to the regions ranging from Southern Mexico to Central America and the Greater Antilles of the Caribbean, especially Jamaica [@czarra_spices_2009 146]. Where naturalized, it spreads by birds carrying the seeds. Allspice has been since introduced to a few neighboring places, such as Colombia, Venezuela, and Florida [@powo_pimenta_2022 146]. In 1885 it was introduced from Jamaica to Hawaii and Kauai, and it even reached Tonga.\nAllspice is cultivated as a crop in a few countries, notably in Jamaica, Mexico, and to a lesser extent in Honduras and Grenada. The primary producer and the source of the highest quality being Jamaica. Saplings are grown from seeds, then soon transplanted when still small. The trees need well-drained soil and humid conditions [@van_wyk_culinary_2014 210]. It is one of the only spices that no one managed to grow in the East, transplantation efforts were quickly abandoned, and its commercial cultivation is confined to the Americas [@duke_crc_2002 21]. Harvesting happens similarly to how black pepper is harvested; the still green, unripe fruits are picked by hand, and then dried under the sun.\nThe flavor of allspice mainly comes from the component eugenol, which is dominant both in the fruit and the leaves, but other compounds also add to the complexity of its aroma. Eugenol\u0026mdash;also called clove oil, for it constitutes 80-90% of the essential oil from clove buds [@barnes_herbal_2007 166]\u0026mdash;is widely used as a flavoring agent by the food industry and in pharmacology, and is also found in cinnamon, nutmeg, and bay leaves. It has antiseptic, antibacterial, anesthetic, and analgesic properties [@ulanowska_biological_2021]. The leaves of a related plant called the West Indian Bay Tree () is used to produce bay rum, a popular essential oil used by the perfume industry for its spicy notes.\nThe History of Allspice\r#\rThere is not much we know about allspice before the arrival of the Europeans, except that the Aztecs used it to spice up their chocolate drink [@farrell_spices_1985 27], although @dalby_dangerous_2000 [145, 177] doubts this was the case that early on. According to @duke_crc_2002 [21], the Maya used allspice for embalming. We know that it reached Europe as a consequence of Christopher Columbus\u0026rsquo;s voyages. Spanish colonizers must have encountered allspice in the West Indies sometime after Columbus and his crew explored the islands of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica, and the year 1494 is reported [@opara_culinary_2021 12]. Columbus himself did not find it. In fact, he did not recognize any spice he was so keen on finding\u0026mdash;pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon\u0026mdash;but kept himself and his patrons in the delusion that he will. In his first letter to Ferdinand and Isabella he writes: \u0026ldquo;On this island there are many spices and great mines of gold and other metals. [...] I believe that I have found rhubarb and cinnamon.\u0026rdquo; [@columbus_spanish_1893 10-18] \u0026mdash;in reality, he had none.2\nHe was adamant that the islands he discovered were full of spices and brought up excuse after excuse (out of season, etc.) after every voyage he returned with no spice [@dalby_dangerous_2000 149]. He also believed that he was in India or Cathay, on one of the outlying islands. Between apologies, Columbus also promised more gold, silver, cotton, mastic, and slaves. As @dalby_dangerous_2000 [150] reports, what he recorded in his private journal is a bit more honest and realistic version of events: \u0026ldquo;I think that many trees and plants grow here which will be highly valued in Spain for dyes and medicinal spices. But I am sorry to say that I do not recognize them.\u0026rdquo; Columbus repeatedly regrets his ignorance in botany in his journal [see also @columbus_journal_2010 57].\nInterestingly, authors love to claim that Columbus brought back allspice (together with vanilla and chili): \u0026ldquo;He returned with allspice from the West Indies, chilies from Mexico and vanilla from Central America.\u0026rdquo; [@craze_spice_1997 17], and \u0026ldquo;Columbus brought it back to Europe thinking it was pepper.\u0026rdquo; [@czarra_spices_2009 146], or \u0026ldquo;Though he did not find the Spice Islands, Columbus brought allspice, vanilla and red peppers from the West Indies back to his Spanish supporters.\u0026rdquo; [@parthasarathy_chemistry_2008 1]. This is not true, he most likely never even saw allspice, but it was reported him that it is there and can be cultivated, along with cinnamon, and mulberry for silk production [@colon_life_1959 151]. Columbus returned from his first voyage of 1492\u0026ndash;93 with some gold nuggets and jewelry, pearls, a hammock, tobacco, the turkey, and a few poor captured Taínos, but no spices were presented to the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. He did bring back pineapple and cassava [@turner_spice_2004 11].\nDiego Álvarez Chanca, the court appointed physician who accompanied Columbus on his second expedition in 1493 is often credited with bringing home both chili, and allspice [@mccormick_history_nodate], but in his 1494 letter describing the flora and fauna, he only mentions agi, also axi\u0026mdash;modern Spanish ají from Taíno\u0026mdash;[see @corominas_breve_1987 34], and that the natives use it to season their food, with what we now know as : the chili pepper [@chanca_american_2003 311].\nIn the following century the Spanish tried to turn Mexico into a spice plantation by transplanting eastern spices, an effort that mostly failed. Only after this did the colonizers start to pay proper attention to native spices [@machuca_past_2020 6].\nFrancisco Hernández de Toledo, King Philip II\u0026rsquo;s court physician and naturalist spent 7 years in New Spain between 1571\u0026ndash;1577, studying its species and conducting interviews with the natives. He was the first to formally describe allspice. He called it Pipere Tavasci \u0026lsquo;Tabasco pepper\u0026rsquo; (today Pimienta de Tabasco, after the region of Tabasco, famous today for a brand of hot sauce. Hernández also recorded the Nahuatl name of allspice: xocoxochitl \u0026lsquo;sour flower\u0026rsquo;.3 Hernández likens the flowers to pomegranates, and and the aroma to that of orange blossoms, describing it to be very pleasant and attractive, with a sharp taste of the fruit. [@hernandez_cuatro_1615 2]. In @machuca_past_2020\u0026rsquo;s translation:\n\u0026ldquo;Xocoxochitl meaning sour flower, is a large tree, with leaves like those of the oranges, red flowers like a pomegranate, but with an aroma like the orange blossom, and in such a smooth and pleasant way, that even the leaves of the tree add to its attraction: the fruit is round, and hangs in clusters, which at first appear green, and then beige, and finally towards black: it is sharp and scathing to taste, and good-smelling\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to @machuca_past_2020, although allspice was known by the Spanish from early on \u0026ldquo;there are few historical records of its production and trade\u0026rdquo;, and only in the century started they to consider American products to have economic potential.\nAllspice berries are around 30% larger then peppercorns, and since their color and shape resembles black pepper, and it gave a spicy taste to food, it is no wonder that the Spanish called them pimiento \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo;. The Portuguese version is pimento, and later the botanical name Pimenta was given to the genus of plants related to allspice [@farrell_spices_1985 26]. I disagree with the often repeated trope that the Spanish explorers mistook allspice berries for pepper and called them pimiento \u0026ldquo;by mistake\u0026rdquo;4, these people knew exactly what they were looking for, and that what they have found is not the mighty black pepper; but for them it was a kind of pepper. The crew showed samples of pepper and cinnamon to presumably confused Native Americans hoping for directions, and as Columbus wrote in his journal on the of November, 1492, they indicated by sign language that there is a lot of it around [@duke_crc_2002 21; @columbus_journal_2010 67]. The Europeans, however, soon recognized the value of allspice, even if it was not the expensive black pepper, but still more pungent and exotic than some cheap Old World substitutes, the juniper and myrtle berries (which are very similar to allspice in appearance and usage) [@dalby_dangerous_2000 150].\nIn short, allspice was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards in the century, its import was first recorded in 1601, according to @britannica_allspice_nodate and @farrell_spices_1985 [26]. After 1655, when Jamaica became a British colony for nearly three centuries, the Brits developed a taste for allspice and started to use it to season meat dishes, sauces, and pickles [@green_field_2006 74]. They were also responsible for its spread to some extent which is illustrated by the names of allspice in some languages, e.g. Polish ziele angielskie \u0026lsquo;English herb\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Names of Allspice\r#\rAllspice is a fascinating case, because it gives us examples for a plethora of names that showcase us many of the motivations, mechanisms, and solutions people choose when naming spices. As I mentioned before, some people are puzzled if allspice is a spice blend or not. The names in some languages often just add to the confusion, for example French quatre-épices (lit. \u0026lsquo;four spices\u0026rsquo;) can have the sense \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo;, but also \u0026lsquo;a kind of spice mix\u0026rsquo; made up of four different spices.5\nEnglish\r#\r::: note Introducing the Etymology box. This environment, as seen above in Etymology [ety:allspice]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;ety:allspice\u0026rdquo;}, offers a quick look at a words\u0026rsquo; origins and development. :::\nSince its introduction to the spice cabinet, allspice has been known by many names from which currently allspice seems to be prevailing. Allspice was formed by compounding all and spice, for its flavor was perceived to be a combination of four characteristic spices that the Europeans knew and sought after: black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.6 It was first recorded in 1621: \u0026ldquo;Ambergreese, nutmegs, and all spice.\u0026rdquo;7, and probably inspired the French toute-épice \u0026lsquo;all-spice\u0026rsquo;, attested in 1762.8\nSadly, the original word for allspice was lost with the demise of the native Taíno people of the Caribbean, nevertheless we got Taíno9 words such as barbecue, cassava, guava, hammock, and tobacco [@rafinesque_american_1836 229]. As we concluded before, it is assumed that it was the Spanish who first got in contact with the allspice berry, and that they simply called it pimienta \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo;.\nFor a long time pimento (and to a much lesser extent pimiento)\u0026mdash;the words for \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo; in Portuguese and Spanish, respectively\u0026mdash;was commonly used in English to refer to allspice. This is still the case in Jamaican English for example, where the term allspice is not used. In North American English however, pimento now rather refers to a small, round variety of chili pepper (), commonly known as cherry pepper explained in [note:pimento]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;note:pimento\u0026rdquo;}.\nThe corruption and mix-up between the English words pimento and pimiento and their origins is as confusing as it gets. For the sake of a clear understanding, let us first consider the modern names for allspice in Spanish: pimienta de Jamaica, and Portuguese: pimenta-da-jamaica. In both cases, pim(i)enta, with a final -a, means \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo;, referring to peppercorns of the usual black and white pepper (). In Spanish and Portuguese, the words endings of -o and -a mark the grammatical gender, the significance of which dissipates in English. It is important to remember however, that the Spanish form pimienta emerged first from a Latin neuter plural suffix in the century. Thus, perhaps a century or so later when the word pimienta was already embedded in Spanish, speakers perceived the word as a feminine noun, and a vacuum of a masculine counterpart emerged. This allowed for a practical differentiation by gender between the peppers of the Old Word and the New World. @corominas_breve_1987 [459] explains that pimiento derived from pimienta, and it was first applied in the Americas for the red fruits of the chili.\n@gomez_de_silva_elseviers_1985 [415] makes the most compact distinction: \u0026ldquo;pimienta \u0026lsquo;(black) pepper; allspice\u0026rsquo;, pimiento \u0026lsquo;(hot and sweet) pepper\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;. In contemporary Spanish, pimiento (the masculine form) refers to the fruits and plants of the Capsicum family, e.g. the numerous spicy chilies and mild bell peppers of red, green, and yellow, while pimienta (the feminine form) refers to the small round fruits of black and white pepper and its powdered forms. The distinction seems consistent, belonging to this latter group see for example pimienta dulce \u0026lsquo;sweet pepper\u0026rsquo;, and pimienta gorda \u0026lsquo;fat pepper\u0026rsquo; both of which refers to allspice, not to be confused with pimiento dulce, which refers to sweet paprika powder.10\nPimento in English is a partly Portuguese, partly Spanish borrowing, while pimiento comes from Spanish. In fact, it is explained in the [OED]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;OED\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;} that in the \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo; sense of the word, pimento, from Portuguese pimenta (da Jamaica), went through an alteration influenced by the Spanish word form, which is not attested in the \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo; sense. Ergo, Spanish pimiento maybe did not refer to allspice in Spanish at the time when the borrowing happened. And if so, pimento is a borrowing from Portuguese pimenta meaning \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo; and, as pimenta da Jamaica, \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo;, influenced by Spanish pimiento \u0026lsquo;chili, sweet pepper\u0026rsquo;, also in the sense of the pepper plants of both kinds (chili and black). Spanish pimiento formerly had the sense of \u0026lsquo;black pepper, peppercorns, and ground pepper\u0026rsquo; (before 1495), with an earlier form pimienta ( century), now usually in sense ground pepper and peppercorns11. The Portuguese connection is only discussed by the [OED]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;OED\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;}, other dictionaries do not mention it. A direct Spanish borrowing is also plausible if we consider that it was the Spanish who most likely brought it back first, they probably called it pimiento/-a, and they were responsible for its subsequent diffusion in Europe. English spellings varied greatly of this this Romance word, using forms such as piemente in the late 1600s.\nThe origin of these words is the classical Latin pigmentum \u0026lsquo;a material for coloring, a color, paint, pigment\u0026rsquo;, with a transferred meaning \u0026rsquo;the juice of plants\u0026rsquo; in post-classical Latin.12 The word pigmentum is made up of pingō \u0026rsquo;to paint\u0026rsquo; and -mentum, a suffix denoting an \u0026lsquo;instrument, medium\u0026rsquo;, well recognizable from Romance languages and English (i.e. excitement). According to @corominas_breve_1987 [459], Catalan pimienta is attested in the century and it comes from the plural (pigmenta) of Latin pigmentum \u0026lsquo;coloring, paint\u0026rsquo;, which already meant \u0026lsquo;drug, ingredient\u0026rsquo;, and later, \u0026lsquo;condiment\u0026rsquo; in Medieval Latin. Derived from this, in 1495 pimiento was applied to the the plants bearing the pungent red fruits of the Americas. Pigmentum also entered English as pigment \u0026lsquo;paint, dye, ingredient in an ointment, drug\u0026rsquo;. According to the [OED]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;OED\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;}, Medieval Latin pigmentum also referred to spiced drinks ( century), perfumes, and hence spice in general. Old French cognates support this, pigment had the sense of \u0026lsquo;balm, fragrant spice\u0026rsquo; in the century, Anglo-Norman pigment/piment meant \u0026lsquo;spice, spice wine\u0026rsquo;13, and Middle English pihmentum ( century, later piment) had a sense of \u0026ldquo;a spiced drink, a remedy or concoction containing spices\u0026rdquo;,14 \u0026ldquo;a sweetened, spiced wine used for refreshment and in medical recipes; a medicinal potion\u0026rdquo;.15 Piment in French were later applied for chili, especially the cultivar of cayenne pepper. (The [OED]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;OED\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;} points to the sense \u0026lsquo;cayenne pepper\u0026rsquo; in a \u0026quot; century French source\u0026rdquo;, which must be an error.)\nAllspice is also known as Jamaica pepper, for it mainly grows on the island and the historical reasons described above. Many languages calqued pimienta de Jamaica from Spanish, or another transmitting language (e.g. Italian pepe della Giamaica). Jamaica pepper was first recorded in 1661: \u0026ldquo;A kind of Pepper, that tastes like Cloves, and very Aromatick (known by the name of Iamaica-Pepper)\u0026rdquo;.16\nThe name myrtle pepper echoes the similarities of the allspice tree with European myrtle (), especially after the resemblance of their purple berries. Beyond the physical resemblance, myrtle berries are also edible, and are also dried to add to pepper mills as a spice. Furthermore, the European myrtle has aromatic leaves and wood as well, and it is used to grill and smoke meat in Southern Europe since Roman times, especially on Sardinia and Corsica; the same way the Caribbean people use allspice wood and leaves. The myrtle berry appears in Roman and Greek mythology as well [@van_wyk_culinary_2014 186].\nThe name clove pepper has \u0026ldquo;chemical reasons\u0026rdquo;, namely that this name arises from the aroma of allspice that reminded people of clove. This is due to its eugenol content we discussed above. Szegfűbors lit. \u0026lsquo;clove-pepper\u0026rsquo; is the most common name for allspice in Hungarian still, and it is used in sausage making.\nOne of the most interesting spice names we can come across in my opinion is newspice. The term is now archaic in English, but the idea still exists in a few European languages, such as Serbian and Macedonian najgvirc from German (Neugewürz), Czech and Slovak (nové koření/korenie), and Turkish yenibahar and Romanian ienibahar from Ottoman Turkish yeñibahar; all the above literally meaning \u0026rsquo;new spice\u0026rsquo;.\nThe reason behind these names is that during the 17- centuries, allspice \u0026ldquo;suddenly\u0026rdquo; arrived to Central and Eastern Europe as a new (and possible marketed as a trendy) spice. This happened a century after the red hot paprika took the world by storm (by century it reached Hungary from the Ottoman Empire), and while the chili did not conquer northern Europe, allspice\u0026mdash;to an extent\u0026mdash;did. We could philosophize why the chili did not deserve the name \u0026rsquo;new spice\u0026rsquo; when it first arrived, or why the Europeans\u0026mdash;except on the south\u0026mdash;were reluctant to assimilate it into their cuisines. Was the pungent chili too harsh for a Northern palate to consider? Is it the sophisticated chemical complexity of allspice that made it fashionable in Victorian England? All these questions are leading us to deep waters regarding the human palate and cultural attitudes toward spices and spiciness, as well as environmental and genetic factors deciding the heat of preference explored by interesting papers such as @tornwall_why_2012 [@spence_why_2018].\nWe know that in the beginning allspice was overlooked by Europeans, and this is possibly the reason why allspice\u0026rsquo;s original name did not survive unlike the Nahuatl word chīlli. Allspice was was later sold and used in beverages and cookery, but its rising star never came close to that of chili. In Asia, where chilies were adopted early on and, eagerly transplanted, they transformed and revolutionized cuisine forever. It is unimaginable to think of Indian, Indonesian, or Chinese dishes without chilies today. Inversely, allspice is mostly unknown in East Asia, and the reasons behind it are just as botanical as historical: In the 16- century nobody knew how to grow allspice, while chili can be grown everywhere effortlessly. In addition, Europeans did not sail to Asia to sell spices, they went to take them.\nAs the century came around, allspice\u0026mdash;the only spice still exclusively imported from the Western hemisphere\u0026mdash;quietly became one of the many, and its fervor faded a little. America was not new anymore, and the name new spice as well became obsolete. An English textbook for students of Italian narrates a letter from 1680 about this Nuova Spezie and the author\u0026rsquo;s opinion on it:\n\u0026ldquo;I Am much obliged to you for the Drug you sent me inclosed in your last letter, about which I cannot tell you any thing but that it is called the New Spice, and it comes as it is said, or as it is guessed, from the West-Indies, and not from the East-lndies; and it is but six months that I had knowledge of it from Count Laurence Magalotti, who showed it me under the abovesaid name of New Spice. How many different tastes are found in it by several honest folks ! that of the clove is the principal ; that of the nutmeg is the second in rank ; the cinnamon comes as it were the third in order ; next the citron ; then the smell of the musk and of the amber, and the most sweet taste of sugar. The truth is, in my opinion, that it is a pretty Drug. I am in Florence, and with for an occasion to do you service ; so command me with all freedom, and be certain that I will count it as good luck to have any power to serve you. I affectionately kiss your hands. Florence, 26th March 1680.\u0026rdquo; [@baretti_introduction_1755 5]\nAnd so, we have established a few categories when it comes to the names of allspice: (1) names that are made up of spice as a headword and a modifying word, (2) names that use pepper as a headword with a modifier, and (3) names that are taken from Portuguese and Spanish. See [table:names_allspice_en]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;table:names_allspice_en\u0026rdquo;} for a concise overview.\nArabic\r#\rArabic, similarly to English, boasts with a diverse set of names when it comes to allspice. First and foremost, it is known as filfil ifranjī \u0026lsquo;European pepper\u0026rsquo;. Ifranjī literally translates to \u0026lsquo;Frankish\u0026rsquo;, but it became the epithet of white Europeans, similarly to the term farang17 in Southeast Asia. The rationale behind this name is evident: it was Europeans who introduced this spice to the Middle East and North Africa in the centuries following its debut.\nAllspice\u0026rsquo;s Middle Eastern history is the topic I have found the least amount of information on, considering every other spice in this chapter. As it is an ingredient that have arrived long after the classical times, it is not discussed in the literature I have consulted, and modern articles only deal with it for its pharmaceutical and health benefits, not with its journey. The challenge to find further Arabic synonyms is also increased, because both English names allspice and pimento are ambiguous. I have found examples of wrongly glossed entries in both Arabic, and Chinese dictionaries. Be that as it may, I have managed to collect a few other Arabic names for allspice from contemporary dictionaries, these can be seen in [table:names_allspice_ar]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;table:names_allspice_ar\u0026rdquo;}.\nFurther common vernacular names are fifil ḥulw lit. \u0026lsquo;sweet pepper\u0026rsquo;, and bahār ḥulw lit. \u0026lsquo;sweet spice\u0026rsquo;, where bahār \u0026lsquo;spice\u0026rsquo;, is a loanword from Persian. Persian bahār means spring (the season), it was borrowed into Arabic with a sense of blossoms and foliage, alluding to the leaves and flowers of plants as the source of many spices.18 In the \u0026lsquo;spice, seasoning, condiment\u0026rsquo; sense, the word spread regionally via Ottoman Turkish (loaned from Arabic). Similarly to the case of English, the word for spice was associated with the allspice berries, and consequently resulted in the already mentioned Turkish yenibahar [newspice] \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo;, and bachári \u0026lsquo;allspice\u0026rsquo;. Thus, just like English, Arabic propagates allspice names by using the words for \u0026lsquo;spice\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;pepper\u0026rsquo; with modifiers indicating qualities of taste, or who carried the spice.\nChinese\r#\rIn Chinese, allspice goes by the name duōxiāngguǒ [many-spice-fruit], supposedly a Chinese rendering of allspice. However, in China allspice is practically non-existent; it is not used in dishes, does not feature in [TCM]{acronym-label=\u0026ldquo;TCM\u0026rdquo; acronym-form=\u0026ldquo;singular+short\u0026rdquo;} databases, and generally unknown besides Western specialty grocery shops. A search in Baidu Index yields no results as well. All the names except tián hújiāo \u0026lsquo;sweet (black) pepper\u0026rsquo; shown in [table:names_allspice_zh]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;table:names_allspice_zh\u0026rdquo;} are relatively modern semantic translations of presumably English sources. Just like in Arabic, it obviously does not show up in pre-modern corpora, and scarcely present in the modern corpus.\nSummary\r#\rshows all the names of allspice that can be found in dictionaries, in a trilingual setting.\nThe Icelandic name is allrahanda, literally \u0026lsquo;of all hands\u0026rsquo;, meaning \u0026lsquo;for various purposes\u0026rsquo;; showing its multifaceted uses.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nColumbus\u0026rsquo;s first letter of his first voyage, sent on March 4, 1493 from Lisbon to the Spanish court (and its translation) is also available online at King\u0026rsquo;s College London.
